Changelog
=========

Changes to this project will be documented in this file.

You may browse a formatted and hyperlinked version of this file at <https://unpoly.com/changes>.


1.0.3
-----

This maintenance release addresses two issues that were introduced in version 1.0.0:

- Unpoly can now be loaded with `<script defer>`. This can be used to load your scripts without blocking the DOM parser.
- Unpoly can now be loaded with `<script type="module">`. This can be used deliver a modern JS build to modern browsers only.


1.0.1
-----

This is a maintenance release for Unpoly 1. Expect little to no additional changes for this legacy version. New features will only be added to Unpoly 2.

- `up.request()` will now send Unpoly's version number as an `X-Up-Version` request header. Since `X-Up-Target` is optional in Unpoly 2, server-side integration libraries can look for `X-Up-Version` to reliably detect a fragment update for both Unpoly 1 and 2.
- Fix a bug where the Unpoly banner would still be printed to the development console when `up.log.config.banner = false` is set. (fix by @adam12)


1.0.0
-----

For six years Unpoly has been released under a 0.x version number. To establish the maturity and stability of the project, we're releasing today's version as 1.0.0.

There are only three changes from 0.62.1:

- Fix a bug where `up.util.escapeHTML()` would not escape single quotes.
- Unpoly will no longer wait a JavaScript execution task to boot after `DOMContentLoaded`. This may improve the stability of test suites that previously interacted with the page too soon.
- You may now disable the Unpoly banner in the development console with `up.log.config.banner = false`. (change by @hfjallemark).

This is the last release of the 0.x API line. We're tracking its code in the [`1.x-stable`](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/tree/1.x-stable), but expect little to no changes in the future.

The next release will be [Unpoly 2](https://triskweline.de/unpoly2-slides). It will include major (but mostly backwards compatible) renovations to its API, unlocking many use cases that were not possible with Unpoly 1.


0.62.1
------

This is another maintenance release while we're finishing [the next major version of Unpoly](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/unpoly/FDdVjxbjNLg).

Community members were involved in every change of this release:

- [`up.submit()`](/up.submit) has a new options `{ params }`. It may be used to pass extra form [parameters](/up.Params) that will be submitted in addition to the parameters from the form. (fix by @robinvdvleuten)
- [`a[up-modal]`](/a-up-modal) will now honor an [`[up-cache]`](/a-up-target#up-cache) attribute on the same link. (fix by @adam12)
- Prevent destructor function from being called twice if [`up.destroy()`](/up.destroy) is called twice with the same element (reported by @kratob)
- On devices that don't show a vertical scrollbar, users can no longer scroll the underlying page while a [modal overlay](/up.modal) is open. (reported by @msurdi)


0.62.0
------

This release backports a number of accessibility improvements from [the next major version of Unpoly](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/unpoly/FDdVjxbjNLg).
We encourage everyone to upgrade to this release in order to better support users with visual impairments.

The following changes are included:

- Links with an [`[up-instant]`](/a-up-instant) attribute can now be followed with the keyboard.
- Fragments that are being [destroyed](/up.destroy) now get an [`[aria-hidden=true]`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-hidden_attribute)
  attribute while its disappearance is being animated. When a fragment is being swapped with a new version, the old fragment version is also
  given `[aria-hidden=true]` while it's disappearing.
- [Modal dialogs](/up.modal) now get an [`[aria-modal=true]`](https://a11ysupport.io/tech/aria/aria-modal_attribute) attribute.

The next major version of Unpoly will include additional accessibility improvements. In particular the
new modal ("layer") implementation will implement all best practices for accessible dialogs.


0.61.1
------

This is a maintenance release while we're getting ready for [the next major version of Unpoly](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/unpoly/FDdVjxbjNLg).

- Fix a bug where [`up.destroy()`](/up.destroy) wouldn't clean up the global jQuery cache. This is only relevant when using Unpoly together with jQuery.
- Fields outside a <form> are now recognized when they have a matching [form] attribute (fixes #85)
- [`up.form.fields()`](/up.form.fields) now accepts a jQuery collection as a first argument, as was already documented.


0.61.0
------

This release makes it easier to migrate to a recent version of Unpoly when your app still depends on jQuery.
Unpoly dropped its jQuery dependency with version 0.60.0, but retains optional jQuery support through functions like
[`up.$compiler()`](/up.$compiler) and [`up.$on()`](/up.$on). All Unpoly functions that take a native element as an
argument may also be called with a jQuery collection as an argument.

The following changes to the optional jQuery support were implemented:

- In an ES6 build pipeline, Unpoly's jQuery support no longer requires `window.jQuery` to be defined before
  Unpoly is imported into the build. You still need to define `window.jQuery`, but you may do so at any time in your
  scripts, regardless of load order.
- jQuery support functions like [`up.$compiler()`](/up.$compiler) now fail with a helpful message if the developer
  forgets to define `window.jQuery`.

This release also exposes some convenience functions and selectors:

- New experimental function [`up.event.halt()`](/up.event.halt). It prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM.
  It also prevents other event handlers bound on the same element. It also prevents the event's default action.
- New experimental function [`up.form.fields()`](/up.form.fields).  It returns a list of form fields within the given element.
- The selector [`form[up-validate]`](/form-up-validate) is now supported. It performs
  [server-side validation](/input-up-validate) when any fieldset within this form changes. Previously only the variant
  [`input[up-validate]`](/input-up-validate) was supported.



0.60.3
------

[`[up-validate]`](/up-validate) again recognizes the `[up-fieldset]` attribute to find the form fragment
that should be replaced with validation results.

In the example below, changing the `email` input would only validate the first fieldset:

```html
<form action="/users" id="registration">

  <div up-fieldset>
    Validation message
    <input type="text" name="email" up-validate />
  </div>

  <div up-fieldset>
    Validation message
    <input type="password" name="password" up-validate />
  </div>

</form>
```


0.60.2
------

- When [submitting](/up-form) a form with a GET method, any query parameters in the form's `[action]` URL are now discarded.
  This matches the standard browser behavior when submitting a form without Unpoly.
- When [submitting](/up-form) a form with a POST method, any query parameters in the form's `[action]` URL are now kept in the
  URL, instead of being merged into the form's data payload.
  This matches the standard browser behavior when submitting a form without Unpoly.
- New experimental function [`up.Params.stripURL(url)`](/up.Params.stripURL).
  It returns the given URL without its [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string).


0.60.1
------

- When user does not confirm an [`[up-confirm]`](/a-up-target#up-confirm) link,
  the link's [`.up-active`](/a.up-active) class is now removed (fixes #89)


0.60.0
------

This is a major update with some breaking changes.

### Highlights

- jQuery is no longer required! Unpoly now has zero dependencies.
- New `up.element` helpers to complement [native `Element` methods](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp). You might not even miss jQuery anymore.
- Vastly improved performance on slow devices.
- Utility functions that work with arrays and array-like values have been greatly improved.
- The `up.util` module now plug the worst emissions in JavaScript's standard library: Equality-by-value, empty-by-value and shallow-copy. Your own objects may hook into those protocols.
- You may define a padding when [revealing](/up.reveal).
- Smooth [scrolling](/up.scroll) now mimics [native scroll behavior](https://hospodarets.com/native_smooth_scrolling).
- Fixed many positioning issues with [popups](/up.popup) and [tooltips](/up.tooltip).
- Several modules have been renamed to match the pattern `up.thing.verb()`. `up.dom` is now `up.fragment`, `up.bus` is now `up.event`, `up.layout` is now `up.viewport`.

Details below.


### jQuery is no longer required

jQuery no longer required to use Unpoly. That means Unpoly no longer has any dependencies!

Due to its use of native DOM APIs, Unpoly is now a lot faster. Like, a **lot**. Ditching jQuery also saves you 30 KB of gzipped bundle size and speeds up your own code.

#### Migrating apps that use jQuery

Effort has been made to ensure that migrating to this version is smooth for existing apps that use jQuery.

All Unpoly functions that accept element arguments will accept both native elements and jQuery collections.

You will need to prefix some function calls with `$` to have your callbacks called with jQuery collections instead of native elements:

- The `up.compiler()` callback now receives a [native element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) instead of a jQuery collection. For the old behavior, use `up.$compiler()`.
- The `up.macro()` callback now received a [native element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) instead of a jQuery collection. For the old behavior, use `up.$macro()`.
- The event handler passed to `up.on()` now receives an element instead of a jQuery collection. For the old behavior, use `up.$on()`.

Finally, all Unpoly events (`up:*`) are now triggered as native events that can be received with [`Element#addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). You may continue to use jQuery's [`jQuery#on()`](http://api.jquery.com/on/) to listen to Unpoly events, but you need to access custom properties through `event.originalEvent`.

Also know that if you use jQuery's `$.fn.trigger()` to emit events, these events are not received by native event listeners (including Unpoly). Use `up.emit()` instead to trigger an event that can be received by both native listeners and jQuery listeners.

See below for detailed changes.


### New DOM helpers

A new, experimental `up.element` module offers convience functions for DOM manipulation and traversal.

It complements [native `Element` methods](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp) and works across all [supported browsers](/up.browser) without polyfills.

| `up.element.first()` |  Returns the first descendant element matching the given selector.|
| `up.element.all()` |  Returns all descendant elements matching the given selector.|
| `up.element.subtree()` |  Returns a list of the given parent's descendants matching the given selector. The list will also include the parent element if it matches the selector itself.|
| `up.element.closest()` |  Returns the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.|
| `up.element.matches()` |  Matches all elements that have a descendant matching the given selector.|
| `up.element.get()` |  Casts the given value to a native [Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element).|
| `up.element.toggle()` |  Display or hide the given element, depending on its current visibility.|
| `up.element.toggleClass()` |  Adds or removes the given class from the given element.|
| `up.element.hide()` |  Hides the given element.|
| `up.element.show()` |  Shows the given element.|
| `up.element.remove()` |  Removes the given element from the DOM tree.|
| `up.element.replace()` |  Replaces the given old element with the given new element.|
| `up.element.setAttrs()` |  Sets all key/values from the given object as attributes on the given element.|
| `up.element.affix()` |  Creates an element matching the given CSS selector and attaches it to the given parent element.|
| `up.element.createFromSelector()` |  Creates an element matching the given CSS selector.|
| `up.element.createFromHtml()` |  Creates an element from the given HTML fragment.|
| `up.element.toSelector()` |  Returns a CSS selector that matches the given element as good as possible.|
| `up.element.setAttrs()` |  Sets all key/values from the given object as attributes on the given element.|
| `up.element.booleanAttr()` |  Returns the value of the given attribute on the given element, cast as a boolean value.|
| `up.element.numberAttr()` |  Returns the value of the given attribute on the given element, cast to a number.|
| `up.element.jsonAttr()` |  Reads the given attribute from the element, parsed as [JSON](https://www.json.org/).|
| `up.element.style()` |  Receives [computed CSS styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle) for the given element.|
| `up.element.styleNumber()` |  Receives a [computed CSS property value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle) for the given element, casted as a number.|
| `up.element.setStyle()` |  Sets the given CSS properties as inline styles on the given element.|
| `up.element.isVisible()` |  Returns whether the given element is currently visible.|
| `:has()` |  A non-standard [pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Pseudo-classes_and_pseudo-elements) that matches all elements that have a descendant matching the given selector. |

### Events

- The `up.bus` module has been renamed to `up.event`. We want to normalize Unpoly's API to the pattern `up.thing.verb()` in the future.
- All Unpoly events (`up:*`) are now triggered as native events that can be received with [`Element#addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). You may continue to use jQuery's [`jQuery#on()`](http://api.jquery.com/on/) to listen to Unpoly events, but you need to access custom properties from `event.originalEvent`.
- Properties named `event.$target` and `event.$element` have been removed from *all* Unpoly events.
  Use the standard `event.target` to retrieve the element on which the element was [emitted](/up.emit).
- `up.on()` may now bind to a given element by passing it as an (optional) first argument:

  ```
  up.on(element, '.button', 'click', (event) => { ... })
  ```

  You may use this for [event delegation](https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate).
- The event handler passed to `up.on()` now receives an element instead of a jQuery collection:

  ```
  up.on('click', (event, element) => {
    alert("Clicked on an " + element.tagName)
  })
  ```

  For the old behavior, use `up.$on()`.
- `up.emit()` may now trigger an event on a given element by passing the element as an (optional) first argument:

  ```
  up.emit(element, 'app:user:login', { email: 'foo@example.com' })
  ```
- `up.emit()` option `{ message }` is now `{ log }`.
- `up.emit()` no longer logs by default. You can enable the old efault message with `{ log: true }`.
- `up.event.nobodyPrevents()` option `{ message }` is now `{ log }`.
- The experimental function `up.reset()` was removed without replacement.
- The experimental event `up:framework:reset` was removed without replacement.



### Custom JavaScript

- [Compilers](/up.compiler) may again return an array of destructor functions. The previous deprecation was removed.
- The `up.compiler()` callback now receives a [native element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) instead of a jQuery collection:

  ```
  up.compiler('.button', function(button) {
    alert("We have a new button with class " + button.className)
  })
  ```

  For the old behavior, use `up.$compiler()`.
- The `up.macro()` callback now received a [native element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) instead of a jQuery collection:

  ```
  up.compiler('a.fast-link', function(element) {
    element.setAttribute('up-preload', 'up-preload')
    element.setAttribute('up-instant', 'up-instant')
  })
  ```

  For the old behavior, use `up.$macro()`.



### Forms

- `up:form:submit` no longer has a `{ $form }` property. The event is now [emitted](/up.emit)
  on the form that is being submitted.
- `up.observe()` now accepts a single form field, multiple fields,
  a `<form>` or any container that contains form fields.
  The callback is called once for each change in any of the given elements.
- The callback for `up.observe()` now receives the arguments `(value, name)`, where
  `value` is the changed field value and `name` is the `[name]` of the field element:

  ```
  up.observe('form', function(value, name) {
    console.log('The value of %o is now %o', name, value);
  });
  ```

  The second argument was previously the observed input element as a jQuery collection.
- `up.observe()` now accepts a `{ batch: true }` option to receive all changes
  since the last callback in a single object:

  ```
  up.observe('form', { batch: true }, function(diff) {
    console.log('Observed one or more changes: %o', diff);
  });
  ```
- The default `up.form.config.validateTargets` no longer includes the
  selector `'[up-fieldset]'`.


### Animation

- CSS property names for custom [animations](/up.animation) and [transitions](/up.transition) must be given in `kebab-case`.
  `camelCase` properties are no longer supported.


### Fragment update API

- The module `up.dom` has been renamed to `up.fragment`. We want to normalize Unpoly's API to the pattern `up.thing.verb()` in the future.
- The experimental function `up.all()` has been removed without replacement
- The function `up.first()` has been renamed to `up.fragment.first()` to not be confused
  with the low-level `up.element.first()`.
- The event `up:fragment:destroy` has been removed without replacement. This event was previously emitted before a fragment was removed. The event [`up:fragment:destroyed`](/up:fragment:destroyed) (emitted after a fragment was removed), remains in the API.
- The `up:fragment:destroyed` event no longer has a `{ $element }` property. It now has a `{ fragment }` property that contains the detached element. Like before, it is emitted on the former parent of the destroyed element.
- The properties for the `up:fragment:keep` event have been renamed.
- The properties for the `up:fragment:kept` event have been renamed.
- The properties for the `up:fragment:inserted` event have been renamed.
- The properties for the `up:fragment:destroyed` event have been renamed.


### Utility functions

The `up.util` module now plug the worst emissions in JavaScript's standard library: Equality-by-value, empty-by-value, shallow copy:

- New experimental function `up.util.isEqual()`. It returns whether the given arguments are equal by value.
- New experimental property `up.util.isEqual.key`.
  This property contains the name of a method that user-defined classes
  may implement to hook into the `up.util.isEqual()` protocol.
- `up.util.isBlank()` now returns false for objects with a constructor.
- New experimental property `up.util.isBlank.key`. This property contains the name of a method that user-defined classes may implement to hook into the `up.util.isBlank()` protocol.
- New experimental property `up.util.copy.key`. This property contains the name of a method that user-defined classes may implement to hook into the `up.util.copy()` protocol.

More utility functions to have been added to work with lists:

- New experimental function `up.util.findResult()`.
  It consecutively calls the given function which each element in the given list and
  returns the first truthy return value.
- New experimental function `up.util.flatten()`. This flattens the given list a single level deep.
- New experimental function `up.util.flatMap()`. This maps each element using a mapping function, then flattens the result into a new array.

Some list functions have been renamed to names used in the standard `Array` API:

- `up.util.all()` was renamed to `up.util.every()` to match the standard [`Array#every()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every), and to be less confusing with `up.element.all()`.
- `up.util.any()` was renamed to `up.util.some()` to match the standard
  [`Array#some()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some).
- `up.util.select()` was renamed to `up.util.filter()` to match the standard
  [`Array#filter()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).
- `up.util.detect()` was renamed to `up.util.find()` to match the standard
  [`Array#find()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find).

All functions that worked for arrays now also work for array-like values:

- New experimental function `up.util.isList()`. It returns whether the given argument is an array-like value, like an `Array` or a
  [`NodeList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList).
- `up.util.reject()` now works for all [array-like values](/up.util.isList), not just arrays.
- `up.util.filter()` now works for all [array-like values](/up.util.isList), not just arrays.
- `up.util.find()` now works for all [array-like values](/up.util.isList), not just arrays.
- `up.util.some()` now works for all [array-like values](/up.util.isList), not just arrays.
- `up.util.every()` now works for all [array-like values](/up.util.isList), not just arrays.

And some minor changes:

- `up.util.nextFrame()` has been renamed to `up.util.task()`.
- `up.util.setTimer()` has been renamed to `up.util.timer()`.
- `up.util.toArray() now returns its unchanged argument if the argument is already an array.
- `up.util.copy()` now works with `Date` objects.
- `up.util.isBoolean()` is now stable
- `up.util.escapeHtml()` is now stable
- `up.util.isJQuery()` now returns `false` if no jQuery is loaded into the `window.jQuery` global
- `up.util.unresolvablePromise()` was removed without replacement.
- `up.util.trim()` has been removed without replacement. Use the standard
  [`String#trim()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim) instead.
- `up.util.parseUrl()` now returns the correct `{ hostname }`, `{ protocol }` and `{ pathname }` properties on IE11.
- `up.util.selectorForElement()` is now `up.element.toSelector()`


### Scrolling Viewports

- The `up.layout` module has been renamed to `up.viewport`. We want to normalize Unpoly's API to the pattern `up.thing.verb()` in the future.
- Smooth [scrolling](/up.scroll) now mimics [native scroll behavior](https://hospodarets.com/native_smooth_scrolling):
  - `up.scroll()` no longer takes a `{ duration }` or `{ easing }` option.
  - `up.scroll()` now takes a `{ behavior }` option. Valid values are `auto` (no animation) and `smooth` (animates the scroll motion).
  - You may control the pace of `{ behavior: 'smooth' }` by also passing a `{ speed }` option`.
  - New config property `up.viewport.scrollSpeed`. This sets the default speed for smooth scrolling. The default value (`1`) roughly corresponds to the default speed of Chrome's native smooth scrolling.
- Options for `up.reveal()` have been changed:
  - Options `{ duration }` and `{ easing }` have been removed.
  - New option `{ padding }` to pass the desired padding between the revealed element and the closest [viewport](/up.viewport) edge (in pixels).
  - New option `{ snap }`. It can be `true`, `false` or a pixel number.
  - New option `{ behavior }`
  - New option `{ speed }`. Defaults to `up.viewport.scrollSpeed`.
  - Config property `up.layout.config.snap` has been renamed to `up.viewport.config.revealSnap`.
  - New config option `up.viewport.revealPadding`.
- New experimental function `up.viewport.root()`. It return the [scrolling element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document/scrollingElement)
  for the browser's main content area.
- New experimental function `up.viewport.closest()`. It returns the scrolling container for the given element.
- When a `#hash` anchor is [revealed](/up.reveal) during the initial page load, Unpoly will look for an `[up-id=hash]` before looking for `[id=hash]` and `a[name=hash]`.
- Fix issues with restoring scroll positions when going back on some browsers.


### Navigation feedback

- [`[up-alias]`](/up-nav#matching-url-by-pattern) now accepts one or more asterisks (`*`) anywhere in the pattern.
   It was previously limited to match URLs with a given prefix.


### Performance

- Use of native browser APIs has improved performance drastically.
- `[up-preload]` and `[up-instant]` links no longer bind to the `touchstart` event, increasing frame rate while scrolling.


### Request parameters

The experimental `up.params` module has been replaced with the `up.Params` class.
Wrap any type of parameter representation into `up.Params` to get consistent API for reading
and manipulation.

The following types of parameter representation are supported:

1. An object like `{ email: 'foo@bar.com' }`
2. A query string like `'email=foo%40bar.com'`
3. An array of `{ name, value }` objects like `[{ name: 'email', value: 'foo@bar.com' }]`
4. A [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) object.
   On IE 11 and Edge, `FormData` payloads require a [polyfill for `FormData#entries()`](https://github.com/jimmywarting/FormData).

Supported methods are:

| `new up.Params()` | Constructor. |
| `up.Params#add()` | Adds a new entry with the given `name` and `value`. |
| `up.Params#addAll()` | Adds all entries from the given list of params. |
| `up.Params#addField()` | Adds params from the given [HTML form field](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp). |
| `up.Params#delete()` | Deletes all entries with the given `name`. |
| `up.Params#get()` | Returns the first param value with the given `name` from the given `params`. |
| `up.Params#set()` |  Sets the `value` for the entry with given `name`. |
| `up.Params#toArray()` | Returns an array representation of this `up.Params` instance. |
| `up.Params#toFormData()` | Returns a [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) representation of this `up.Params` instance. |
| `up.Params#toObject()` | Returns an object representation of this `up.Params` instance. |
| `up.Params#toQuery()` | Returns an [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) for this `up.Params` instance. |
| `up.Params#toURL()` | Builds an URL string from the given base URL and this `up.Params` instance as a [query string](/up.Params.toString). |
| `up.Params.fromFields()` | Constructs a new `up.Params` instance from one or more [HTML form field](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp). |
| `up.Params.fromForm()` | Constructs a new `up.Params` instance from the given `<form>`. |
| `up.Params.fromURL()` | Constructs a new `up.Params` instance from the given URL's [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string). |


### Popups

- The HTML markup for a popup has been changed to make it easier to style with CSS.
  The new structure is:

  ```
  <div class="up-popup">
    <div class="up-popup-content">
      Fragment content here
    </div>
  </div>
  ```
- The default CSS styles for `.up-popup` has been changed. If you have customized popup styles,
  you should check if your modifications still work with the new defaults.
- Popups now update their position when the screen is resized.
- Popups now follow scrolling when placed within [viewports](/up.viewport) other than the main document.
- The `[up-position]` attribute has been split into two attributes `[up-position]` and `[up-align]`.
  Similarly the `{ position }` option has been split into two options `{ position }` and `{ align }`:
  - `{ position }` defines on which side of the opening element the popup is attached. Valid values are `'top'`, `'right'`, `'bottom'` and `'left'`.
  - `{ align }` defines the alignment of the popup along its side.
  - When the popup's `{ position }` is `'top'` or `'bottom'`, valid `{ align }` values are `'left'`, `center'` and `'right'`.
  - When the popup's `{ position }` is `'left'` or `'right'`, valid `{ align }` values are `top'`, `center'` and `bottom'`.
- New experimental function `up.popup.sync()`. It forces the popup to update its position when a
  layout change is not detected automatically.
- popup elements are now appended to the respective viewport of the anchor element.
  They were previously always appended to the end of the `<body>`.
- The events `up:popup:open`,`up:popup:opened`, `up:popup:close` and `up:popup:closed` have an `{ anchor }` property.
  It references the element that the popup was [attached](/up.popup.attach()) to.


### Tooltips

- The HTML markup for a popup has been changed to make it easier to style with CSS.
  The new structure is:

  ```
  <div class="up-tooltip">
    <div class="up-tooltip-content">
      Tooltip text here
    </div>
  </div>
  ```
- The default CSS styles for `.up-tooltip` have been changed. If you have customized tooltip styles,
  you should check if your modifications still work with the new defaults.
- Tooltips now update their position when the screen is resized.
- Tooltips now follow scrolling when placed within [viewports](/up.viewport) other than the main document.
- The `[up-position]` attribute has been split into two attributes `[up-position]` and `[up-align]`. Similarly the `{ position }` option has been split into two options `{ position }` and `{ align }`:
  - `{ position }` defines on which side of the opening element the popup is attached. Valid values are `'top'`, `'right'`, `'bottom'` and `'left'`.
  - `{ align }` defines the alignment of the popup along its side.
  - When the tooltip's `{ position }` is `'top'` or `'bottom'`, valid `{ align }` values are `'left'`, `center'` and `'right'`.
  - When the tooltip's `{ position }` is `'left'` or `'right'`, valid `{ align }` values are `top'`, `center'` and `bottom'`.
- New experimental function `up.tooltip.sync()`. It forces the popup to update its position when a
  layout change is not detected automatically.
- Tooltip elements are now appended to the respective viewport of the anchor element.
  They were previously always appended to the end of the `<body>`.


### Ruby on Rails integration

- Unpoly is now compatible with the jQuery-less UJS adapter (now [part of Action View](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actionview/app/assets/javascripts)).


### AJAX acceleration

- The properties for the `up:link:preload` event have been renamed.


### Modal dialogs

- Opening/closing a modal will now manipulate the `{ overflow-y }` style on the same element
  that was chosen by the CSS author ([nasty details](https://makandracards.com/makandra/55801-does-html-or-body-scroll-the-page)).


### Various

- Renamed some files so they won't be blocked by over-eager ad blockers on developer PCs.
- Deprecation warnings are only printed once per environment.




0.57.0
------

### Request parameters

To prevent confusion with [`[up-data]`](/up-data), Unpoly now uses the word "params" when talking about form values or request parameters:

- [`up.request()`](/up.request) option `{ data }` has been renamed to `{ params }`.
- [`up.replace()`](/up.replace) option `{ data }` has been renamed to `{ params }`.

Parameters may be passed in one of the following types:

1. an object like `{ email: 'foo@bar.com' }`
2. a [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) object
3. a query string like `email=foo%40bar.com`
4. an array of `{ name, value }` objects like `[{ name: 'email', value: 'foo@bar.com' }]`

To help working with form values and request parameters, an experimental module [`up.params`](/up.params) has been added. It offers a consistent API to manipulate request parameters independent of their type.

- [`up.params.fromForm()`](/up.params.fromForm) - serialize a `<form>`
- [`up.params.fromURL()`](/up.params.fromURL) - extract params from a URL's query string
- [`up.params.toArray()`](/up.params.toArray) - convert any params type to an array of `{ name, value }` elements
- [`up.params.toObject()`](/up.params.toObject) - convert any params type to an object
- [`up.params.toQuery()`](/up.params.toQuery) - convert any params type to a query string
- [`up.params.toFormData()`](/up.params.toFormData) - convert any params type to a [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) object
- [`up.params.buildURL()`](/up.params.buildURL) - composes a URL with query section from a base URL and a params value of any type
- [`up.params.get()`](/up.params.get) - retrieve the value for the given params key
- [`up.params.add()`](/up.params.add) - adds a single key/value to a params value of any type
- [`up.params.assign()`](/up.params.assign) - adds the params to another params
- [`up.params.merge()`](/up.params.merge) - [merges](/up.util.merge) two params


### Application layout

- When Unpoly cannot find the [viewport](/up.layout.config#config.viewports) of an element, it now uses the scrolling root element. This is either `<body>` or `<html>`, depending on the browser.
- Fix a bug where linking back and forth between multiple `#anchor` hashes of the same URL would always reveal the first anchor.
- Revealing elements below [fixed navigation bars](/up-fixed-top) now honors the navigation bar's `padding`, `border`, `margin`, `top` and `bottom` properties.
- Fix a bug where revealing elements [fixed navigation bars](/up-fixed-top) would scroll 1 pixel too short.
- [`up.layout.revealHash()`](/up.layout.revealHash) no longer retrieves the hash anchor from the current URL. You need to pass in a `#hash` value as a first argument.
- Fix a bug where a `#hash` anchor would not be revealed if it included non-word characters like spaces or dots.


### Compilers

- To improve performance, Unpoly no longer parses [`[up-data]`](/up-data) attributes when a [compiler function](/up.compiler) does not require a second `data` argument.
- Compilers that return [destructor functions](/up.compiler#cleaning-up-after-yourself) now run slightly faster.
- [Compilers](/up.compiler) with `{ batch: true }` now receive an array of [`[up-data]`](/up-data) objects as their second `data` argument.
- [Compilers](/up.compiler) with `{ batch: true }` can no longer return destructor functions. Previously the behavior of batch destructors was undefined, now it throws an error.
- Returning an array of [destructor functions](/up.compiler#cleaning-up-after-yourself) from [`up.compiler()`](/up.compiler) is now deprecated. Please return a single destructor function instead.
- [`up.syntax.data()`](/up.syntax.data) now returns `undefined` if the given object has no (or an empty) [`[up-data]`](/up-data) attribute. It previously returned an empty object.


### Event listeners

- To improve performance, Unpoly no longer parses [`[up-data]`](/up-data) attributes when an [`up.on()`](/up.on) listener does not require a third `data` argument.
- [`up.on()`](/up.on) now throws an error when the same callback function is registered multiple times.


### Fragment update API

- New experimental function [`up.all()`](/up.all), which returns all elements matching the given selector. Like [`up.first()`](/up.first) it ignores elements that are being [destroyed](/up.destroy) or [transitioned](/up.morph).


### Various

- New experimental function [`up.util.isBoolean()`](/up.util.isBoolean).
- [`up.follow()`](/up.follow) now accepts a `{ url }` option. It can be used to override the given link's `[href]` attribute.
- New configuration option [`up.form.config.submitButtons`](/up.form.config#config.submitButtons)
- [`up.preload()`](/up.preload) now accepts an options hash that will be passed on to the function making the preload request.
- New experimental function [`up.Response#getHeader()`](/up.Response.prototype.getHeader). It looks up the header value for the given name in the HTTP response header.



0.56.7
------

- Calling `event.preventDefault()` on [`up:modal:close`](/up:modal:close) and [`up:popup:close`](/up:popup:close) events no longer prints `Uncaught (in promise)` to the error console. You still need to catch rejected promises in your own code when it calls Unpoly functions and that function is prevented by an event handler.


0.56.6
------

- Fix a regression where the contents of `<noscript>` tags were parsed into DOM elements (instead of text) when a fragment contained more than one `<noscript>` element. Thanks to [@foobear](https://github.com/foobear) for helping with this.


0.56.5
------

- Fix a bug where loading a page with both a ?query string and a #fragment hash would throw an error


0.56.4
------

- Improve performance of HTML parsing.


0.56.3
------

- Fix a bug where the Bootstrap 3 integration failed to load. Thanks [@dastra-mak](https://github.com/dastra-mak)!


0.56.2
------

- Fix a bug where [`up.util.reject()`](/up.util.reject) would stop working after an animation.


0.56.1
------

- New stable selector [`.up-destroying`](/up-destroying). This CSS class is assigned to elements before they are [destroyed](/up.destroy) or while they are being removed by a [transition](/up.morph).
- Fix a bug where [`up.first()`](/up.first) would sometimes find an element that is being destroyed.


0.56.0
------

This release includes major performance improvements and a new animation engine.

Beware of the breaking change with [`.up-current`](/up-nav-a.up-current)!


### Navigation feedback

Maintaining the [`.up-current`](/up-nav-a.up-current) on all links turned out to be a major performance bottleneck, so we had to make some breaking changes:

- The [`.up-current`](/up-nav-a.up-current) class is now only assigned to links with an [`[up-nav]`](/up-nav) attribute, or to links within a container with an [`[up-nav]`](/up-nav) attribute. You should assign the [`[up-nav]`](/up-nav) attribute to all navigational elements that rely on `.up-current` for styling`.
- You can also globally configure selectors for your navigational elements in `up.feedback.config.navs`:

      up.feedback.config.navs.push('.my-nav-bar')
- The normalized URLs of [`[up-nav]`](/up-nav) links are now cached for performance reasons.
- [`[up-nav]`](/up-nav) links are only updated once when multiple fragments are updated in a single [replacement](/a-up-target).


### Animation

- When performing an [animated page transition](/up.motion) Unpoly will no longer create copies of the old and new fragment versions. The animation will instead be performed on the fragment elements themselves.
- When animating an element with an existing [CSS transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions), Unpoly will now pause the CSS transition in its current state, perform the animation, then resume the CSS transition.
- Unpoly now does less work when animation is disabled globally through `up.motion.config.enabled = false`.
- [`up.morph()`](/up.morph) will now expect the new fragment version to be detached from the DOM before morphing.
- [`up.morph()`](/up.morph) will now detach the old fragment version from the DOM after morphing.
- The [`up.morph()`](/up.morph) function has been demoted from *stable* to *experimental*.
- [`up.motion.finish()`](/up.motion.finish) now longer queries the DOM when there are no active animations.


### Application layout

- When Unpoly cannot find the viewport of an element, it will now always considers `document` to be the viewport.


### Fragment updates

- The [`up:fragment:destroyed`](/up:fragment:destroyed) event is now emitted after the fragment has been removed from the DOM. The event is emitted on the former parent of the removed fragment.


### Utility functions

- Fix a bug where [`up.util.isBlank()`](/up.util.isBlank) returned `true` for a function value
- Fix a bug where [`up.util.only()`](/up.util.only) did not copy properties inherited from a prototype


### General

- Partially remove jQuery from internal code for performance reasons. We want to eventually remove jQuery as a dependency.
- Cache the results of feature detection for performance reasons.
- Unpoly is now more efficient when selecting elements from the DOM.
- Unpoly is now more efficient when reacting to mouse events.



0.55.1
------

This release restores support for Internet Explorer 11, which we accidentally broke in 0.55.0.

Thanks to [@foobear](https://github.com/foobear) for helping with this.


0.55.0
------

### Fragment updates

- Unpoly now detects when an [`[up-target]`](/up-target) with multiple selectors would [replace](/up.replace) the same element multiple times. In such a case the target selector will be shortened to contain the element once.
- Unpoly now detects when an [`[up-target]`](/up-target) with multiple selectors contains nested elements. In such a case the target selector will be shortened to only contain the outmost element.


### Utility functions

- [`up.util.uniq()`](/up.util.uniq) now works on DOM elements and other object references.
- New experimental function [`up.util.uniqBy()`](/up.util.uniqBy). This function is like [`uniq`](/up.util.uniq), accept that the given function is invoked for each element to generate the value for which uniquness is computed.
- Changes to [utility functions](/up.util) that work on lists ([`up.util.each()`](/up.util.each), [`up.util.map()`](/up.util.map), [`up.util.all()`](/up.util.all), [`up.util.any()`](/up.util.any), [`up.util.select()`](/up.util.select), [`up.util.reject()`](/up.util.reject)):
  - List functions now accept a property name instead of a mapping function:

    ```
    users = [{ name: 'foo' }, { name: 'bar' }]
    up.util.map(users, 'name') // ['foo', 'bar']
    ```
  - List functions now pass the iteration index as a second argument to the given function:

    ```
    users = [{ name: 'foo' }, { name: 'bar' }]
    up.util.map(users, function(user, index) { return index }) // [0, 1]
    ```

0.54.1
------

This release contains no new features, but will help you when using tools like Babel or Webpack:

- Unpoly now ship without any uses of [`eval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval) in its JavaScript sources. Use of `eval()` had previously prevented minifiers from shortening local variables in some files.
- Documentation in Unpoly's JavaScript sources can no longer be confused with [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) comments. Unpoly does not use JSDoc, but some build pipelines eagerly look for JSDoc comments to generate type information.


0.54.0
------

### Passive updates

- [`[up-hungry]`](/up-hungry) elements will now also be updated when the server responds with an error code. This helps when `[up-hungry]` is used to display error messages.

### Forms

- When a [form is submitted](/form-up-target) you can now consistently refer to that form element as `&` in CSS selectors ([like in Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#parent-selector)).

  E.g. to reveal the first error message within a failed form submission:

  ```
  <form id="my-form" up-target=".page" up-fail-reveal="& .error">
    ...
  </form>
  ```

  In this case `& .error` will be replaced by `#my-form .error` before submission.

  This affects CSS selectors in the following HTML attributes:

  - `form[up-target]`
  - `form[up-fail-target]`
  - `form[up-reveal]`
  - `form[up-fail-reveal]`


### Linking to fragments

* When a [link is followed](/a-up-target) you can now consistently refer to that link element as `&` in CSS selectors ([like in Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#parent-selector)).

  This affects CSS selectors in the following HTML attributes:

  - `a[up-target]`
  - `a[up-fail-target]`
  - `a[up-reveal]`
  - `a[up-fail-reveal]`


### Fragment update API

- New option for [`up.replace()`](/up.replace): `{ keep: false }` will disable preservation of [`[up-keep]`](/up-keep) elements.
- New option for [`up.replace()`](/up.replace): `{ hungry: false }` will disable updates of [`[up-hungry]`](/up-hungry) elements.



0.53.4
------

### Passive updates

- Updates for [`[up-hungry]`](/up-hungry) elements will no longer auto-close a [modal dialog](/up.modal).
- Updates for [`[up-hungry]`](/up-hungry) elements will no longer auto-close a [popup overlay](/up.popup).
- CSRF-related `<meta>` tags are no longer updated automatically with every request. This is to prevent unnecessary DOM jitter in applications that don't rotate CSRF tokens.

### Popup overlays

- Calling `up.popup.attach()` without a target selector will now throw an error.


0.53.2
------

### General

- Failed requests in event handlers of CSS selectors like `form[up-target]` no longer print `Uncaught (in promise)` to the error console. You still need to catch and handle rejected promises in your own code when it calls Unpoly functions.

### Animated transitions

- Fix a bug where a page transition would flicker if [revealing](/up.reveal) was animated globally by setting `up.layout.config.duration`.

### Preloading

- Fix a bug where [preloading](/a-up-target) would not always be aborted when stopping to hover before [`up.proxy.config.preloadDelay`](/up.proxy.config#config.preloadDelay).


0.53.1
------

### General

- Fix a bug where replacing the first element on the page (in DOM order) would shift the scroll position if animation is disabled.
- Fix a bug where query params would be lost when Unpoly would fall back to a full page load.

### Optional server protocol

- The optional cookie the server can send to [signal the initial request method](/up.protocol#signaling-the-initial-request-method) will now be removed as soon as Unpoly has booted.

### Animations

- Fix a bug where the animation `move-from-top` would finish instantly after animating with `move-to-top`.
- Fix a bug where the animation `move-from-right` would finish instantly  after animating with `move-to-right`.
- Fix a bug where the animation `move-from-bottom` would finish instantly after animating with `move-to-bottom`.
- Fix a bug where the animation `move-from-left` would finish instantly  after animating with `move-to-left`


0.53.0
------

### New module: Passive updates

Thi work-in-progress package [`up.radio`](/up.radio) will contain functionality to
passively receive updates from the server. Currently the following functionality is implemented:

- Elements with an [`[up-hungry]`](/up-hungry) attribute are [updated](/up.replace) whenever there is a matching element found in a successful response. The element is replaced even when it isn't [targeted](/a-up-target) directly.

  Use cases for this are unread message counters or notification flashes. Such elements often live in the layout, outside of the content area that is being replaced.
- When a reserver response contains a `<meta name="csrf-param">` or `<meta name="csrf-token">` element, it is automatically updated in the current page.


### General

- Changes when generating CSS selectors for elements:
  - `[aria-label]` attributes are used if no better attributes exist (like `[id]` or `[up-id]` attributes).
  - Attribute values with quotes are now escaped if they appear in an attribute selector.
  - Attribute selectors now use double quotes instead of single quotes.
  - When a `[name]` attribute is used, the tag name is also used. E.g. `meta[name="csrf-token"]`.
  - Element IDs that contain non-word characters (e.g. slashes, spaces, dots), will now generate an attribute selector like `[id="foo/bar"]`.

### Forms

- You can give forms an `[up-fail-reveal]` attribute to indicate which element should be [revealed](/up.reveal) when the server responds with an error. You may use this, for example, to reveal the first validation error message:
  ```
  <form up-target=".content" up-fail-reveal=".error">
    ...
  </form>
  ```
- Forms with an `[up-reveal]` attribute will now only honor the attribute when the form submission was successful.
- Forms with an `[up-restore-scroll]` attribute will now only honor the attribute when the form submission was successful.
- Forms with an `[up-reveal="css-selector"]` attribute will no longer crash when the selector could not be found.
- Fix a bug where you couldn't submit a form if it's ID contains a slash character ([#46](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/issues/46)).

### Links

- You can give links an `[up-fail-reveal]` attribute to indicate which element should be [revealed](/up.reveal) when the server responds with an error
- Links with an `[up-reveal]` attribute will now only honor the attribute when the link could be followed successfully.
- Links with an `[up-restore-scroll]` attribute will now only honor the attribute when the link could be followed successfully.
- Links with an `[up-reveal="css-selector"]` attribute will no longer crash when the selector could not be found.

### Animations

- When [replacing](/up.replace) multiple elements, it is no longer possible to use different [transitions](/up.morph) for each element. The same transition is always applied to all elements.



0.52.0
------

### Browser support

- No longer prints an error to console when registering a [macro](/up.macro) on an unsupported browser.

### AJAX requests

- Unpoly can now detect the final URL of a redirect response without the [optional server protocol](/up.protocol).
  The server protocol is still needed to detect redirects on Internet Explorer 11.
- When making HTTP requests Unpoly will now always merge params in the URL's query section with params from the `{ data }` option.

### Forms

- [Following](/up.follow) a link now emits an [`up:link:follow`](/up:link:follow) event. The event can be prevented.

### Forms

- [Submitting](/up.submit) a form through Unpoly now emits an [`up:form:submit`](/up:form:submit) event. The event can be prevented.


0.51.1
------

### Fragment updates

- Fix a bug where Unpoly would crash when replacing a fragment with a `<script>` tag with a later sibling element.


0.51.0
------

### Fragment updates

- `<script>` tags that were inserted by a fragment update are no longer executed. They are still executed during the initial page load. If you need a fragment update to call JavaScript code, call it from a compiler ([Google Analytics example](https://makandracards.com/makandra/41488-using-google-analytics-with-unpoly)).
- The configuration option `up.dom.config.runInlineScripts` has been removed without replacement.
- The configuration option `up.dom.config.runLinkedScripts` has been removed without replacement.
- Fix a bug where the contents of `<noscript>` tags were parsed into DOM elements (instead of a single verbatim text node). This was confusing libraries that work with `<noscript>` tags, such as [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes).
- Work around a [bug in IE11 and Edge](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/12453464/) where `<noscript>` tags that were inserted by a fragment update could not be found with jQuery or `document.querySelectorAll()`.


0.50.2
------

### Fragment updates

- Updating fragments is now much faster when no [`[up-keep]`](/up-keep) elements are involved.

### Scrolling

- [`up.reveal()`](/up.reveal) no longer crashes when called with a CSS selector or non-jQuery element.
- [`up.reveal()`](/up.reveal) now returns a rejected promise when no viewport could be found for the given element.

### Links

- [`[up-expand]`](/up-expand) now ignores clicks on [form fields](/up.form.config#config.fields). This is useful e.g. when `up-expand`ing a table row that contains both links and form fields.

### Network

- [`a[up-preload]`](/a-up-preload) will no longer preload a link when the user holds the Shift, Ctrl or Meta key while hovering.


0.50.1
------

### General

- Boolean HTML attributes are now also considered `true` if their values equal the attribute name, e.g. `up-keep="up-keep"` ([#36](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/issues/36))

### AJAX

- [`up.request()`](/up.request) now sends an `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` headers. This header is used by many server-side frameworks to detect an AJAX request. ([#42](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/issues/42))


0.50.0
------

This is a major update with some breaking changes. Expect a few more updates like this as we move closer to our 1.0 release in 2018.

### General

- jQuery 3 is now supported in addition to jQuery 1.9+ and jQuery 2.
- Unpoly now uses [native Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) instead of jQuery deferreds.
- You can now help improve Unpoly's documentation by clicking an *Edit this page* link on any [unpoly.com](https://unpoly.com/) subpage (like [`a[up-target]`](/a-up-target)).

### Browser support

- To enable support for Internet Explorer 11 you need to install a Polyfill for `Promise`. We recommend [ES6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) (2.4 KB gzipped).
- Fix a bug where Unpoly would not boot on Safari 9 and 10 if the initial page was loaded with a `POST` method.

### AJAX

- Unpoly now uses [native XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) instead of `jQuery.ajax()`. If you have been hacking into Unpoly's networking through `jQuery.ajaxPrefilter()`, you must now use the [`up:proxy:load`](/up:proxy:load) event.
- [`up.ajax()`](/up.ajax) has been deprecated since its signature is incompatible with native promises. Please use [`up.request()`](/up.request) instead, whose promise fulfills with an [`up.Response`](/up.Response) object.
- The `up:proxy:received` event has been renamed to [`up:proxy:loaded`](/up:proxy:loaded).
- The [`up:proxy:load`](/up:proxy:load) event properties have changed. You can now access request properties through a key `{ request }`, e.g. `event.request.url`.
- The [`up:proxy:load`](/up:proxy:load) event can now be prevented to prevent a request from being sent to the network.
-  The [`up:proxy:load`](/up:proxy:load) event now allows listeners to change request headers by manipulating the `event.request.headers` object.
- A new event [`up:proxy:fatal`](/up:proxy:fatal) will be [emitted](/up.emit) when an [AJAX request](/up.request) encounters fatal error like a timeout or loss of network connectivity.

### Links

- Links with unsafe HTTP methods like `POST` are no longer marked as [`.up-current`](/a.up-current), even if their `[href]` matches the current URL.
- New experimental function [`up.link.isSafe()`](/up.link.isSafe). It returns whether the given link has a [safe](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.1) HTTP method like `GET`.

### Fragment updates

- When a selector was not found in the response, the error notification now offers a link to show the unexpected response.
- The event [`up:fragment:destroy`](/up:fragment:destroy) can no longer be prevented.

### History

- Clicking a link with an [`[up-restore-scroll]`](/a-up-target#up-restore-scroll) attribute will no longer crash if no previous scroll position for given URL is known ([#25](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/issues/25))
- Fix a bug where going back in history would sometimes not call destructors ([#24](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/issues/24))

### Forms

- [`up.observe()`](/up.observe) no longer sends multiple callbacks when a previous callback was slow to respond.

### Tooltips

- Fix a bug where tooltips would sometimes stay open when many tooltips are opened and closed concurrently.

### Server protocol

- When the server [signals a redirect with a `X-Up-Location` header](/up.protocol#redirect-detection), sending a `X-Up-Method` header is now optional. If it is missing, `GET` is assumed.
- Unpoly will often update a different selector in case the request fails. This second selector is now sent to the server as a `X-Up-Fail-Target` header.
- You can now [configure how CSRF tokens are sent your server-side framework](/up.protocol.config).
- CSRF tokens are no longer sent for cross-domain requests.

### Animation

- `up.motion.none()` has been removed without replacement. Just pass `false` or the string `'none'` to indicate a animation or transition which has no visual effects and completes instantly.
- [`up.motion.finish()`](/up.motion.finish) is now async. It returns a promise that fulfills when all animations are finished.
- [`up.motion.finish()`](/up.motion.finish) now also finishes animations in ancestors of the given element.

### Modals

- [`up.follow()`](/up.follow) will now open a modal if the given link has an [`[up-modal]`](/a-up-modal) attribute
- [`a[up-modal]`](/a-up-modal) links can now have an `[up-fail-target]` attribute to indicate which selector to replace for an non-200 response
- Fix a bug where preloading an up-modal link would create an invisible .up-modal container in the DOM.

### Popups

- [`up.follow()`](/up.follow) will now open a popup if the given link has [`[up-popup]`](/a-up-popup) attribute
- up-popup links can now have an up-fail-target attribute to indicate which selector to replace for an non-200 response
- Fix a bug where preloading an up-popup link would create an invisible .up-popup container in the DOM.
- [`up.popup.attach()`](/up.popup.attach) now throws an error if neither `{ url }` nor `{ html }` options are given.

### Events

- When async functions emit an event and that event is prevented, the async function now rejects with an [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error).
- When async functions are called wth `{ confirm: true }` and the user denies confirmation, the async function now rejects with an [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error).

### Utility functions

- [`up.util.setTimer()`](/up.util.setTimer) is now always async, even when called with a delay of `0` (zero). The function is now stable.
- `up.util.isHash()` has been removed without replacement. In your code you can replace `up.util.isHash(x)` with `up.util.isObject(x) && !up.util.isFunction(x)`.
- `up.util.resolvedDeferred()` has been removed without replacement. Use `Promise.resolve()` instead.
- `up.util.resolvedPromise()` has been removed without replacement. Use `Promise.resolve(`) instead.
- `up.util.rejectedPromise()` has been removed without replacement. Use `Promise.reject()` instead.
- `up.util.unresolvableDeferred()` has been removed without replacement. Use `new Promise(function() {})` instead.
- `up.motion.when()` has been removed without replacement. Use `Promise.all()` instead.
- [`up.util.isString()`](/up.util.isString) now also returns true for `String` instances (in addition to string literals)
- [`up.util.isNumber()`](/up.util.isNumber()) now also returns true for `Number` instances (in addition to number literals)

### Ruby on Rails bindings

- New method `up.fail_target` available in controllers, helpers and views. It returns the selector targeted for a failed response.
- New method `up.fail_target?(target)` available in controllers, helpers and views. It returns whether the given selector is targeted for a failed response.
- New method `up.any_target?(target)` available in controllers, helpers and views. It returns whether the given selector is targeted for a either a successful or failed response.



0.37.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where [replacing](/up.replace) the `<body>` element would not trigger [destructor functions](/up.compiler#cleaning-up-after-yourself) in the old `<body>`.
- Fix a bug where [`[up-layer]`](/up-layer) attributes or `{ layer }` options were ignored.
- [`a[up-target]`](/a-up-target) and [`form[up-target]`] get a new modifying attribute `[up-fail-layer]`.
  Use it to set the layer to update if the server sends a non-200 status code. Valid values are `auto`, `page`, `modal` and `popup`.
- JavaScript functions like [`up.replace()`](/up.replace) or [`up.submit()`](/up.submit) now have a `{ failLayer }` option.


0.36.2

0.36.0
------

### Compatible changes

- The [`[up-observe]`](/up-observe) attribute can now be set on a `<form>` to run a function if any
  contained input field changes.
- Fix a bug where [`[up-autosubmit]`](/form-up-autosubmit) didn't honor an `[up-delay]` attribute if
  used on a form.
- When [submitting a form](/form-up-target), the `name` and `value` of the submit button is now included with the form parameters.
- [Going back in history](/up.history) after a [fragment update](/up.link) now always restores elements the page layer, never a selector in [modals](/up.modal) or [popups](/up.popup).
- [Going back in history](/up.history) now always closes a [modal](/up.modal) or [popup](/up.popup).
- Switch to [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) as our [CDN](/install/cdn).


0.35.2
------

### Compatible changes

- `unpoly-rails` now supports Rails 5


0.35.1
------

- Elements with [`up-show-for`](/up-show-for) and [`up-hide-for`](/up-hide-for) attributes
  can now be inserted dynamically after its controlling [`up-switch`](/input-up-switch) field has been
  compiled.
- Unpoly no longer strips a trailing slash in the current URL during startup


0.34.0
------

### Compatible changes

- During the initial page load Unpoly now [reveals](/up.reveal) an element matching the
  `#hash` in the current URL.

  Other than the default behavior found in browsers, `up.revealHash` works with
  [multiple viewports](/up-viewport) and honors [fixed elements](/up-fixed-top) obstructing the user's
  view of the viewport.
- New experimental function [`up.layout.revealHash()`](/up.layout.revealHash).
- The optional server protocol is now [documented](/up.protocol).

- The event [`up:history:restored`](/up:history:restored) is no longer emitted when a history state
  was not created by Unpoly.


0.33.0
------

### Compatible changes

- When a fragment updates cannot find the requested element, you can now define a fallback selector to use instead.

  A `{ fallback }` option has been added to all Javascript functions that update fragments, like [`up.replace()`](/up.replace).

  Also an `[up-fallback]` attribute has been added to all CSS selectors that update fragments, like for [`a[up-target]`](/a-up-target).

  You can also define fallbacks globally using the [`up.dom.config`](/up.dom.config) property.
- Unpoly no longer crashes when a request fails due to a timeout or network problem. In such cases, async functions (like [`up.replace()`](/up.replace)) will leave the page unchanged and  reject the returned promise.
- Functions that make a request (like [`up.replace()`](/up.replace) or like [`up.ajax()`](/up.ajax)) now accept a new option `{ timeout }`.
- [Modals](/up.modal) no longer create an `.up-modal` element when the server returns a non-200 status and the `{ failTarget }` is replaced instead
- [Popups](/up.popup) no longer create an `.up-popup` element when the server returns a non-200 status and the `{ failTarget }` is replaced instead
- Improve performance when updating fragments without transitions
- When updating the `body` element with a transition, that transition is now silently ignored instead of throwing an error.
- [`up.util.resolvedPromise()`](/up.util.resolvedPromise) now accepts arguments which will become the resolution values.
- [`up.util.resolvedDeferred()`](/up.util.resolvedDeferred) now accepts arguments which will become the resolution values.
- New utility method [`up.util.rejectedPromise()`](/up.util.rejectedPromise).
- [`up.first()`](/up.first) has new option `{ origin }`. You can use it provide a second element or selector that can be referenced as `&` in the first selector:

      $input = $('input.email');
      up.first('.field:has(&)', $input); // returns the .field containing $input
- Fix a bug where the document title wasn't restored when the user uses the back button
- When [revealing a page fragment](/up.reveal), Unpoly will include the element's top and bottom margin in the area that should be revealed.


### Breaking changes

- [`up.replace()`](/up.replace) now returns a rejected promise if the server returns a non-200 status code.
- `up.util.merge()` has been replaced by [`up.util.assign()`](/up.util.assign), which no longer makes exceptions for `null` and `undefined` property values. This behaves like [`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign).
- The `up.flow` module has been renamed to [`up.dom`](/up.dom).
- The `up.navigation` module has been renamed to [`up.feedback`](/up.feedback).
- Functions that measure position, dimensions or margin now return floats instead of rounded integers.


0.32.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where morphing an [`[up-keep]`](/up-keep) element with a destructor would throw an error.
- Fix a bug where an [`[up-keep]`](/up-keep) element would lose its jQuery event handlers when it was kept.
- Fix a bug where [`up.log.disable()`](/up.log.disable) did not persist through page reloads.
- Fix a bug where [`up.reveal()`](/up.reveal) would scroll too far if the viewport has a `padding-top`.
- Fix a bug where [`up.reveal()`](/up.reveal) would not scroll to an element at the bottom edge of the visible area
  if [`up.layout.config.snap`](/up.layout.config) is set.
- Several features have been promoted from experimental API to stable API:
  - [`[up-drawer]`](/a-up-drawer)
  - [`up.syntax.data()`](/up.syntax.data)
  - [`up.extract()`](/up.extract)
- When [targeting](/up-target) an URL with a #hash, the viewport will now scroll to the first row of an element
  with that ID, rather than scrolling as little as possible.


### Breaking changes

- [Modals](/up.modal) can no longer grow wider than the screen
- The spacing around a modal dialog is longer implemented as a `margin` of `.up-modal-dialog`.
  It is now a padding of `.up-modal-viewport`. This makes it easier to set the `width` or `max-width` of the dialog box.

  If your project has custom Unpoly styles, you should grep your CSS files for changes to the `margin`
  of `.up-modal-dialog` and set it as a `padding` on `.up-modal-viewport[flavor=default]` instead.


0.31.2
------

### Compatible changes

- Unpoly can now be installed as an npm module called `unpoly`.


0.31.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Drawers are now a built-in modal flavor! Use the [`[up-drawer]`](/a-up-drawer) attribute to open page fragements
  in a modal drawer that slides in from the edge of the screen.


### Breaking changes

- The [`up.modal.flavor()`](/up.modal.flavor) function was deprecated. Set values on the

- Fix some issues when using Unpoly together with Bootstrap modals.



0.29.0
------

### Compatible changes

- [`up.popup.attach()`](/up.popup.attach) now has a `{ html }` option. This allows you to extract popup contents
  from a HTML string without making a network request.
- [`up.tooltip.attach()`](/up.tooltip.attach) now has a `{ text }` option which automatically escapes the given string.
- Fix a bug on Firefox where the page width would jump by the scrollbar width when opening a modal.
- Fix a bug where modals would close when following a link to a cached destination.

### Breaking changes

- Events handled by Unpoly selectors will no longer bubble up the DOM.


0.28.1
------

0.28.0
------

### Compatible changes

- The error notification is now easier to read and can be closed.
- When a target selector was not found in the response, the error notification now offers a link to re-request the response for inspection.
- [Compilers](/up.compiler) can now return an array of functions that will *all* be called when the element is destroyed.
- [`up.observe()`](/up.observe) now works on checkboxes and radio buttons.
- [`up.observe()`](/up.observe) can now be called with multiple form fields, or any container that contains form fields.
- When opening a [modal](/up.modal) you can now pass an option `{ closable: false }` or set an `up-closable='false'` attribute
  This lets you disable the default methods to close a modal (close button, clicking on the backdrop, pressing ESC).
  You can also configure this globally by setting [`up.modal.config.closable`](/up.modal.config).
- Fix a bug where [`up.observe(form, options)`](/up.observe) would not respect options.
- Fix a bug where [`up.autosubmit(form)`](/up.autosubmit) was not published.
- Fix a bug where falling back to non-AJAX page loads on old browsers would not work

### Breaking changes

- `up.error()` has been renamed to [`up.fail()`](/up.fail) in order to prevent confusion with [`up.log.error()`](/up.log.error).


0.27.3
------

### Compatible changes

- [Popups](/up.popup) and [modals](/up.modal) will no longer try to restore a covered document title
  and URL if they were opened without pushing a history entry.
- When fragments are [replaced](/up.replace) without pushing a new history entry,
  the document title will no longer be changed by default.


### Breaking changes

- The `{ url }` option for [`up.destroy()`](/up.destroy) has been renamed to `{ history }` to be more
  in line with [`up.replace()`](/up.replace).


0.27.2
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where the back button would not work if the document contained carriage returns (`\r`).
- Fix a bug where auto-closed modals and popups would overwrite a changed
  browser location with their cached "covered URL"


### Breaking changes

- Links with [`up-target`](/up.target) now prefer to update elements within their own layer (page, modal, or popup).
  Only when the target element doesn't exist within the link's layer, Unpoly will look through all layers
  from top to bottom.



0.27.1
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where absolutely positioned elements would be offset incorrectly during transitions
- Fix a bug where inserted elements were not revealed within their viewport
- When [validating](/input-up-validate) a form with transitions, transitions are no longer applied


### Breaking changes

- When [replacing](/up.replace) multiple page fragments at once, only the first fragment is revealed within its viewport


0.27.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Calling [`up.log.enable()`](/up.log.enable) will now keep logging enabled for the remainder of this
  browser session (and persist through page reloads).
- Added experimental events to observe history changes: [`up:history:push`](/up:history:push) (preventable), [`up:history:pushed`](/up:history:pushed) and [`up:history:restored`](/up:history:restored)
- Fix a bug where prepending or appending multiple elements with `:before` / `:after` pseudo-classes
  would not work correctly in tables.
- Fix a bug where calling [`up.animate()`](/up.animate) with `{ duration: 0 }` would return a promise
  that never resolved.
- A click on the page body now closes the popup on `mousedown` instead of `click`.
  This fixes the case where an `[up-instant]` link removes its parent and thus a `click` event never bubbles up to the body.
- When opening a modal, elements behind the dialog can now be moved correctly when scrollbars have custom styles on `::-webkit-scrollbar`.
  To take advantage of this, make sure to also style scrollbars on elements with an [`[up-viewport]`](/up-viewport) attribute.
- Fix a bug where [`up.tooltip.config`](/up.tooltip.config) was not publicly acccessible.
- Fix a bug where [`up.tooltip.isOpen()`](/up.tooltip.isOpen) was not publicly acccessible.
- New [tooltip configuration options](/up.tooltip.config): `config.openDuration`, `config.closeDuration`, `config.openEasing`, `config.closeEasing`
- Opening/closing many tooltips concurrently now behaves deterministically.
- Opening/closing many popups concurrently now behaves deterministically.
- Opening/closing many modals concurrently now behaves deterministically.
- IE9 fixes: Polyfill `window.console` and several properties (`log`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `group`, `groupCollapsed`, `groupEnd`)


### Breaking changes

- Tooltips now open and close much quicker.
- Popups now open and close much quicker.
- [`.up-current`](/a.up-current) now considers two URLs different if they have different query strings.

- [`up-modal`](/a-up-modal) and [`up-popup`](/a-up-popup) now support an `up-method` modifier.



0.26.1
------

### Breaking changes

- When inserting a page fragment with a `<script src="...">` tag, the linked JavaScript is no longer loaded and executed. Inline scripts will still be executed. You can configure this behavior using the new [`up.flow.config`](/up.flow.config) property.



0.26.0
------

### Compatible changes

- [Popups](/up.popup) no longer scroll with the document if they are attached to an element with `position: fixed`
- [Tooltips](/up.tooltip) no longer flicker if an [`[up-tooltip]`](/up-tooltip) elements has children
- [Tooltips](/up.tooltip) no longer flicker if the user moves the mouse too close to the tooltip triangle
- Before [compiling](/up.compile) the body, Unpoly now explicitly waits until user-provided compiles have been registered and the DOM is ready.
- Debugging messages in the developer console are now disabled by default. Call [`up.log.enable()`](/up.log.enable) to get them back.
- New configuration options in [`up.log.config`](/up.log.config): `up.log.config.enabled`, `up.log.config.collapse` and
  `up.log.config.prefix`.
- Improve formatting of error messages.
- New experimental utility function [`up.util.escapeHtml()`](/up.util.escapeHtml).
- If an error is thrown before the document is ready, Unpoly now waits until the document is ready before showing the red error box.



0.25.2
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where [submitting a form](/form-up-target) with file uploads would throw an error `"Cannot convert FormData into a query string"`



0.25.1
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where [`up.ajax()`](/up.ajax) would incorrectly re-use form responses even if the form data differed
- Fix a bug with the [`up-observe`](/up-observe) UJS attribute throwing an error when used
- Fix a bug where if multiple compilers with [destructors](/up.compiler#cleaning-up-after-yourself)
  are applied to the same element and the element is removed, only the last destructor was called.


0.25.0
------

### Compatible changes

- New modal default [`up.modal.config.sticky`](/up.modal.config)
- New experimental function [`up.modal.flavor()`](/up.modal.flavor) to register modal variants (like drawers).
- Fix a bug where [compilers](/up.compiler) and [macros](/up.macro) with higher priorities were executed last (instead of first like it says in the docs).
- Fix a bug that would occur if two compiled elements, that were nested within each other, would raise an error if the outer element was destroyed and both compilers have destructor functions.
- Fix a bug where replacing the `body` tag would raise an error if any element in the old `<body>` had a destructor function.
- The promise returned by [`up.replace()`](/up.replace) now waits for transitions to complete before resolving
- Fix a bug where an error would be shown when opening a modal while another modal was still loading
- Fix a bug where two popups would be shown when opening a popup while another popup was still loading
- New options for [up.popup.config](/up.popup.config):
  - `up.popup.config.openDuration`
  - `up.popup.config.closeDuration`
  - `up.popup.config.openEasing`
  - `up.popup.config.closeEasing`
- Modals now longer addsa right padding to the `<body>` if the document has no vertical scroll bars
- Animations now wait until the browser signals completion of the CSS transition. Previously
  animations were canceled after its duration, which might or might not have matched to the actual
  last animation frame.

### Breaking changes

- When opening a modal while another modal is open, the first modal will be closed (with animation) before the second modal opens (with animation)
- When opening a popup while another popup is open, the first popup will be closed (with animation) before the second popup opens (with animation)
- User-defined macros are now always run *before* built-in macros.
  This way you can set [`a[up-dash]`](/a-up-dash) and [`[up-expand]`](/up-expand) from your own macros.


0.24.1
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug that would stop transitions from working.

- Fix a bug where [`up-active`](/a.up-active) classes where not removed from links when the destination
  was already [preloaded](/up.preload).


### Breaking changes

- Animations when opening or closing a [modal](/up.modal) now only affect the viewport around the dialog.
  The backdrop is animated separately. This allows animations like "zoom in", which would look strange if
  the backdrop would zoom in together with the dialog.
- The modal's HTML structure has been changed to include a `.up-modal-backdrop` element:

  ```
  <div class="up-modal">
  <div class="up-modal-backdrop">
  <div class="up-modal-viewport">
    <div class="up-modal-dialog">
      <div class="up-modal-content">
        ...
      </div>
      <div class="up-modal-close" up-close>X</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  </div>
  ```

- The `z-index` properties for modal elements have been [changed](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/blob/master/lib/assets/stylesheets/unpoly/modal.css.sass).
  They might change again in the future.
- The modal will now take over the document's scrollbars after the open animation has finished.
  In earlier versions the modal took over as soon as the animation had started.
- Calling [`up.motion.finish()`](/up.motion.finish) with an element will now also
  complete animations/transitions on children of the given element.


0.23.1
------

### Compatible changes

- [Animations](/up.motion) `move-to-*` and `move-from-*` now use CSS transforms instead of manipulating the
  bounding box margins.
- Fix [`up.util.trim()`](/up.util.trim) not working properly.
- [`up.morph()`](/up.morph) no longer throws an error if called without an `options` object
- Custom transitions can now call [`up.morph()`](/up.morph) to refer to other transitions

  link marked with a [up-active](/a.up-active) class forever.


0.23.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Unpoly forms can now [submit](/up.submit) file uploads via AJAX.
- You can now position [tooltips](/up-tooltip) on the left or right side of an element.

- The tooltip CSS has been changed to be easier to override.


0.22.1
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where the document title wasn't restored when using the back
  and forward buttons
- Fix a bug where links would be followed multiple times if the link
  had an [`up-dash`](/a-up-dash) attribute without a value and also an `up-target` attribute.
- Fix a bug where a link would be followed multiple times if the link's
  click area was expanded using [`[up-expand]`](/up-expand) and if the
  link also had an [`up-dash`](/a-up-dash) attribute.
- [`up.destroy()`](/up.destroy) now returns a resolved deferred if the given selector or jQuery collection does not exist


0.22.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where using the `up-confirm` attribute would result in an infinite loop
- Unpoly no longer displays confirmation dialogs when [preloading](/a-up-preload) a link that
  has both [`up-preload`](/a-up-preload) and `up-confirm` attributes.


### Breaking changes

- `up.proxy.idle()` is now [`up.proxy.isIdle()`](/up.proxy.isIdle)
- `up.proxy.busy()` is now [`up.proxy.isBusy()`](/up.proxy.isBusy)
- Event `up:proxy:busy` is now [`up:proxy:slow`](/up:proxy:slow)
- Event `up:proxy:idle` is now [`up:proxy:idle`](/up:proxy:recover)


0.21.0
------

### Compatible changes

- New function `up.macro()`. This registers a [compiler](/up.compiler) that is run before all other compilers.
- [`up.compiler()`](/up.compiler) has a new options `{ priority }`. Compilers with higher priorities are run first.
- Fix a bug where trying to apply another transition on an element could throw a *Maximum call stack exceeded*
    error if the element was already transitioning.

### Breaking changes

- `up-toggle` has been renamed to `up-switch`


0.20.0
------

- The project has been renamed to *Unpoly*.
- All functions remain in the `up` namespace, so e.g. `up.replace()` is still called `up.replace()`.

0.19.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Elements can now be persisted during page updates using the [`up-keep`](/up-keep) attribute.
- `up.proxy.ajax()` is now available as [`up.ajax()`](/up.ajax).
- `up.ajax()` can now handle nested objects as `{ data }` option (used to pass form parameters).

### Breaking changes

- `up.implant()` has been renamed to [`up.extract()`](/up.extract).


0.18.1
------

### Compatible changes

- The logging output to the developer console is now much quieter and more useful


0.18.0
------

### Compatible changes

- New UJS attribute [`[up-toggle]`](/up-toggle) to show or hide part of a form if certain options are selected or boxes are checked.
- Links can now have an optional `up-confirm` attribute. This opens a confirmation dialog with the given message
  before the link is followed or the modal/popup is opened.
- New function [`up.off()`](/up.off). This unregisters an event listener previously bound with [`up.on()`](/up.on).
- If a container contains more than one link, you can now set the value of the [`up-expand`](/up-expand)
  attribute to a CSS selector to define which link should be expanded.
- You can now configure a list of safe HTTP methods in [`up.proxy.config.safeMethods`](/up.proxy.config).
  The proxy cache will only cache safe requests and will clear the entire
  cache after a unsafe request.
- Loading modals and popups will now open if there is a fragment update between the modal/popup's
  request and response.
- [`up.follow()`](/up.follow) and [`up.replace()`](/up.replace) now have an option `{ failTarget }`.
  Use it to define the selector to replace if the server responds with an error.
- [`[up-target]`](/a-up-target) and [`up-follow`](/a-up-follow) now have a modifying attribute `up-fail-target`.
  Use it to define the selector to replace if the server responds with an error.
- New utility method [`up.util.reject()`](/up.util.reject)
- New utility method [`up.util.only()`](/up.util.only)
- New utility method [`up.util.except()`](/up.util.except)
- Fix a bug where modals could no longer be opened on some browsers
- When preventing an event emitted by an async function, that function now rejects its promise.
- Async functions that encounter an error now prefer to reject promises with an [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) object (instead of a string with the error message)

### Breaking changes

- By default Unpoly now converts `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests to `POST` requests
  that carry their original method in a form parameter named `_method`.
  This is to [prevent unexpected redirect behavior](https://makandracards.com/makandra/38347).

  Web frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Sinatra are aware of the `_method` parameter and use
  its value as the method for routing.

  You can configure this behavior in [`up.proxy.config.wrapMethods`](/up.proxy.config)
  and [`up.proxy.config.wrapMethodParam`](/up.proxy.config).
- The requested selector is now sent to the server as a request header `X-Up-Target`
  (this used to be `X-Up-Selector`). If you are using `unpoly-rails`, you can access it
  through `up.target` (this used to be `up.selector`).


0.17.0
------

### Compatible changes

- When used with the [Ruby on Rails unobtrusive scripting adapter](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs) (`rails_ujs.js`),
  now prevents duplicate form submission when Unpoly attributes are mixed with `data-method` attributes.
- [`a[up-instant]`](/a-up-instant) now works with modals and popups
- [`[up-expand]`](/up-expand) now works with modals and popups

### Breaking changes

- When [`up.observe()`](/up.observe) is used with a delay of zero, the callback is invoked instantly (instead of
  being invoked in the next animation frame).


0.16.0
------

### Compatible changes

- You can now configure [`up.proxy.config.maxRequests`](/up.proxy.config) to limit
  the maximum number of concurrent requests. Additional
  requests are queued. This currently ignores preloading requests.

  You might find it useful to set this to `1` in full-stack integration
  tests (e.g. Selenium).
- Allow to disable animations globally with `up.motion.enabled = false`.
  This can be useful in full-stack integration tests like a Selenium test suite.
- New function [`up.motion.isEnabled`](/up.motion.isEnabled) to check if animations will be performed.
- [`up.popup.attach()`](/up.popup.attach) now throws a helpful error when trying to attach a popup to a non-existing element
- New option [`up.modal.config.history`](/up.modal.config) to configure if modals change the browser URL (defaults to `true`)
- New option [`up.popup.config.history`](/up.popup.config) to configure if popup change the browser URL (defaults to `false`).
- Fix CSS for popups with a position of `"bottom-left"`.

### Breaking changes

- Popups and modals used to close automatically whenever an element behind the overlay was replaced.
  This behavior is still in effect, but only if the replacement was triggered by a link or element from
  within the popup or modal.
- Popups and modals no longer raise an error if their (hidden) overlay was closed before the
  response was received.
- Popups and modals are now compiled before they are animated.


0.15.1
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix an error where `up.form.config` was not published. This caused `unpoly-bootstrap3.js` to throw an error.


0.15.0
------

### Compatible changes

- New function [`up.autosubmit()`](/up.autosubmit) and selector [`[up-autosubmit]`](/form-up-autosubmit) to
  observe a form or field and submit the form when a value changes.
- [`up.observe()`](/up.observe) and [`[up-observe]`](/up-observe) can now be applied
  to `<form>` tags. The callback is run when any field in the form changes.
- New function [`up.browser.canPushState()`](/up.browser.canPushState) to detect
  if the browser supports `history.pushState`.
- New function [`up.browser.canCssTransition()`](/up.browser.canCssTransition) to
  detect if the browser supports animation with CSS transitions.
- New function [`up.browser.canInputEvent()`](/up.browser.canInputEvent) to
  detect if the browser supports the `input` event.
- Allow to [configure a default delay](/up.form.config) for [`up.observe()`](/up.observe).
- [Popups](/up.popup) now have events [`up:popup:open`](/up:popup:open),
  [`up:popup:opened`](/up:popup:opened), [`up:popup:close`](/up:popup:close)
  and [`up:popup:closed`](/up:popup:closed).
- The destructor returned by [`up.observe()`](/up.observe) now properly unregisters
  event listeners.

### Breaking changes

- [`up.observe()`](/up.observe) now takes the callback function as a last argument.
  The callback can now longer be passed as a `.change` option.


0.14.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Published the [up.util](/up.util) module.
  This might save you from loading something like [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/).


0.13.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Support for server-side live validation of forms
  using the [`[up-validate]`](/input-up-validate) selector.
- Support for [non-standard CSS selectors from jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/),
  such as [`:has`](http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/) or [`:visible`](http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/).
- Allow to refer to the current element as `&` in target selectors. This is useful
  to reference containers that contain the triggering element, e.g.
  `<a href="/path" up-target=".container:has(&)">`
- Improve automatic generation of selectors for elements when no
  explicit selector is given.
- Forms with `file` inputs will now cause forms to fall back to a standard submission without AJAX.
  In a future release we will be able to submit file inputs via AJAX.
- The [request cache](/up.proxy) now reuses responses for `body` and `html` when asked for other selectors.
- Server responses can now change the document title by including an `X-Up-Title` header.


0.12.5
------

### Compatible changes

- `a[up-target]` and `up.follow` now scroll to a #hash in the link's destination URL
- When up.replace cannot make a change in old browsers, return an unresolved promise instead of a resolved promise.


0.12.4
------

### Compatible changes

- When [morphing](/up.morph), prevent flickering caused by long repaint frames
- When [morphing](/up.morph) don't un-highlight current navigation sections in the element that is being destroyed. This makes for a smoother transition.
- Fix a bug where compositing wasn't forced properly during an animation


0.12.3
------

Refactored internals. No API changes.


0.12.2
------

### Compatible changes

- When marking links as `.up-current`, also consider the URL behind a current modal or popup to
  be the "current" URL.


### Breaking changes

- `up.bus.emit()` is now [`up.emit()`](/up.emit)
- When `up.first()` finds no match, return `undefined` instead of `null`.


0.12.1
------

### Compatible changes

- `up.on()` now returns a function that unbinds the events when called
- Fixed a bug where restoring previous scroll positions was not worked
  in situations where the same operation would also reveal the replaced element.
- Various bugfixes


0.12.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Unpoly can now be used with [`jQuery.noConflict()`](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/).


### Breaking changes

- Remove `up.slot`, which was poorly implemented, untested, and not much better than the `:empty` pseudo-selector
  which has great browser support
- Replaced the `up.bus.on(...)` event registry with vanilla DOM events bound to `document`. Also renamed
  events in the process.

  Instead of the old ...

      up.bus.on('fragment:ready', function($fragment) {
        ...
      };

  ... you now need to write ...

      $(document).on('up:fragment:inserted', function(event) {
        var $fragment = $(this);
        ...
      };

  ... or shorter:

      up.on('up:fragment:inserted', function(event, $fragment) {
         ...
      };
- Renamed `up.ready()` to `up.hello()`. This will emit an `up:event:inserted` event for the given element,
  causing it to be compiled etc.
- `up.popup.open()` has been renamed to `up.popup.attach()`.
- `up.modal.open()` has been split into two methods `up.modal.visit(url)` and `up.modal.follow($link)`.
- `up.tooltip.open()` has been renamed to `up.tooltip.attach()`.
- Tooltips now escape HTML by default; To use HTML content, use an `[up-tooltip-html]` attribute instead.
- Module configurations are now simple properties like `up.layout.config` instead of methods like `up.layout.defaults(...)`.

  Instead of the old ...

      up.layout.defaults({ snap: 100 });

  ... you now need to write:

      up.layout.config.snap = 100;


0.11.1
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where browsers without CSS animation support would crash after an animation call
- Expose `up.error()` as public API. This prints an error message to the error console and throws a new `Error` with that message.
- Fix a million bugs related to compatibility with IE9 and IE10


0.11.0
------

### Compatible changes

- Rework the scrolling implementation so we don't need to scroll elements to the top before replacing them.
- `up.ajax()` now only caches responses with a status code of `200 OK`
- When a link with an `[up-close]` attribute is clicked, the link's default action will only be prevented
  if the link was actually within a modal or popup.
- When revealing an element, Up will now compute the correct element position if there are
  additional positioning contexts between the viewport and the element
- New option "top" for `up.reveal()`: Whether to scroll the viewport so that the first element row aligns with
  the top edge of the viewport. Without this option, `up.reveal()` scrolls as little as possible.
- Allow to animate scrolling when the `document` is the viewport.
- New `up.layout` setting `fixedRight` that contains selectors for elements that are anchored to
  the right edge of the screen. When opening a modal, these elements will be prevented from jumping
  around. If you're using `unpoly-bootstrap3.js`, this will default to `['.navbar-fixed-top', '.navbar-fixed-bottom', '.footer']`.
- Fix a bug in `unpoly-rails` where the gem would fail to `include` itself in some versions
  of Ruby and Rails.


### Breaking changes

- Interactions that would result in an URL change ("pushState") now fall back to a full page load
  if Unpoly was booted from a non-GET request. [More information about the reasons for this](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/commit/d81d9007aa3bfae0fca8c55a71d180d1044acae5).

  This currently works out of the box if you're using Unpoly via the `unpoly-rails` Rubygem.
  If you're integrating Unpoly with Bower or manually, you need to have your server app
  set an `_up_request_method` cookie with the current request method on every request.


0.10.5
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where the proxy would remain busy forever if a response failed.


0.10.4
------

### Compatible changes

- Fix a bug where hovering multiple times over the same [up-preload] link would
  not trigger a new request after the cache expired


0.10.3
------

### Compatible changes

- The default viewport is now `document` instead of the `<body>` element.


0.10.2
------

### Breaking changes

- While following links and submitting forms will still reveal elements by default,
  direct calls of [`up.replace()`](/up.replace) no longer do.
  This behavior can be activated using the `{ reveal: true }` option.

### Compatible changes

- Options to control scrolling and cache use for
  [`up.submit()`](/up.submit),
  [`up.follow()`](/up.follow),
  [`up.visit()`](/up.visit),
  [`form[up-target]`](/form-up-target) and
  [`a[up-target]`](/a-up-target).


0.10.1
------

### Breaking changes

- [`up.reveal()`](/up.reveal) now only reveals the first 150 pixels of an element.


0.10.0
-------

### Compatible changes

- Viewport scroll positions are saved when the URL changes and restored when the user hits the back/forward button
- Allow to link to the previous page using [`[up-back]`](/a-up-back)
- Allow to restore previous scroll state using [`[up-restore-scroll]`](/a-up-target)
- Instead of saying `<tag up-something="true">` you can now simply say `<tag up-something>`.
- Create this Changelog.

### Breaking changes

- The option `options.scroll` and attribute `up-scroll` have been removed. Instead you can use the
  boolean option `options.reveal` or `up-reveal` to indicate whether an element should be revealed
  within the viewport before replacement.
- The string `up.history.defaults('popTarget')` is now an array of selectors `up.history.defaults('popTargets')`


0.9.1
-----

0.9.0
-----

### Compatible changes

- Elements are now being [revealed](/up.reveal) within their viewport before they are updated
