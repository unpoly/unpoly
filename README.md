======

Unobtrusive JavaScript framework for server-side applications
-------------------------------------------------------------

[Unpoly](https://unpoly.com) enables fast and flexible frontends with minimal changes to your server-side code.

This repository is home to both the Unpoly JavaScript code and its (optional) bindings for Ruby on Rails (`unpoly-rails` gem).


Getting started
---------------

- See [unpoly.com](https://unpoly.com) for more information and JavaScript API documentation.
- See [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for notable changes.
- See [`README_RAILS.md`](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/blob/master/README_RAILS.md) documentation of the Rails bindings.


Development
-----------

### Running tests

Overview:

- This currently requires Ruby
- There's a Rails app in `spec_app`
- Jasmine tests for Unpoly live in `spec_app/spec/javascripts`
- RSpec tests for the `unpoly-rails` gem live in `spec_app/spec/controllers`

Install dependencies for tests:

- Install Ruby 2.3.8
- Install Bundler by running `gem install bundler`
- Install Node.js (required for building the library)
- `cd` into `spec_app`
- Install dependencies by running `bundle install`

To run Jasmine tests for Unpoly:

- `cd` into `spec_app`
- Start the Rails server by running `rails server`
- Access `http://localhost:3000/specs` to see the Jasmine test runner

To run RSpec tests for the `unpoly-rails` gem:

- `cd` into `spec_app`
- Run `rspec`


### Making a new release

We are currently feeding four release channels:

- Manual download from GitHub
- npm
- Bower (which is based on Git and version tags)
- Rubygems (as the `unpoly-rails` gem)

We always release to all channel simultaneously.

To prepare a new version:

1. Edit `lib/unpoly/rails/version.rb` and bump the version number. Use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).
2. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Commit and push the version bump and `CHANGELOG.md`

Now we can release a new version. **This requires your to be logged into Rubygems and npm**:

1. From the project root, type `rake publish:build`. This will output minified JS and CSS files to the `dist` folder. It also updates the `package.json` for npm.
2. Commit and push the generated files. There is a rake task `rake publish:commit` that helps with this.
3. From the project root, type `rake publish:release`. This will publish a new gem version to Rubygems.org.
4. It will also push a tag for this version, which Bower requires for its own versioning scheme. Finally it publishes to npm.

Always remember to build, commit and push build artifacts before calling `rake publish:release` so the Git tag points to the correct commit.

If you have done this process a few times and know what you're doing, you can call `rake publish:all` to run all these steps in sequence.

After you have published all release channels, remember to:

1. Update [unpoly.com](https://unpoly.com/) so users see the new version, CDN link and CHANGELOG.
2. Send a message to the [E-mail group](https://groups.google.com/group/unpoly) with the title "Unpoly X.Y.Z released". You can copy the relevant CHANGELOG part from [here](http://localhost:4567/changes_google_groups).
