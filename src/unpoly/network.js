Network requests
================

This package implements an optimized HTTP client
that is used for all requests made through Unpoly.

The HTTP client offers many quality-of-life improvements, for example:

- Requests may be [cached](/caching) to re-use responses and enable [preloading](/preloading).
  Cached content is [revalidated](/caching#revalidation) after rendering, so the user never
  sees stale content.
- You may [handle network issues](/network-issues), such as disconnects, flaky connections or low bandwidth.
- A [progress bar](/loading-indicators) is shown when requests take too long to finish.
  You may also implement a [custom loading indicator](/loading-indicators#custom-loading-indicators).
- When two requests [target](/targeting-fragments) the same element,
  Unpoly will [abort the earlier request](/aborting-requests).
- Requests send [additional HTTP headers](/up.protocol) that the server may use to [optimize its response](/optimizing-responses).
  For example, when [updating a fragment](/targeting-fragments), the target selector is automatically sent
  as an `X-Up-Target` header. The server may choose to only render the targeted fragment.
- Useful events like `up:request:loaded` or `up:network:late` are emitted throughout the request/response lifecycle.
- When too many requests are sent concurrently, excessive requests are [queued](/up.network.config#config.concurrency).
  This prevents exhausting the user's bandwidth and limits race conditions in end-to-end tests.

Unpoly's HTTP client is used automatically when rendering, e.g. when [following a link](/up-follow)
or [submitting a form](/up-submit). To use the client from your own JavaScripts, use `up.request()`.

up.network = (function() {

  /*-
  Sets default options for this package.

  @property up.network.config

  @param {number|Function(): number} [config.concurrency]
    The maximum number of concurrently loading requests.

    Additional requests are queued. [Preload](/preloading) requests are
    always queued behind non-preload requests.

    By default Unpoly allows 6 concurrent requests.
    You might find it useful to set a concurrency of `1` in end-to-end tests
    to prevent race conditions.

    Your browser may impose additional concurrency limits  regardless of what you configure here.

  @param {boolean} [config.wrapMethod]
    Whether to wrap non-standard HTTP methods in a POST request.

    If this is set, methods other than GET and POST will be converted to a `POST` request
    and carry their original method as a `_method` parameter. This is to [prevent unexpected redirect behavior](https://makandracards.com/makandra/38347).

    If you disable method wrapping, make sure that your server always redirects with
    with a 303 status code (rather than 302).

  @param {number} [config.cacheSize=70]
    The maximum number of responses to cache.

    If the size is exceeded, the oldest responses will be dropped from the cache.

  @param {number|Function(up.Request): number} [config.badResponseTime=400]
    How long to wait before emitting the [`up:network:late` event](/up:network:late).

    Requests exceeding this response time will also cause a [progress bar](/loading-indicators#progress-bar)
    to appear at the top edge of the screen.

    The value is given in milliseconds.

    @experimental
  @param {number|undefined} [config.timeout=90_000]
    A default [timeout](/up.request#options.timeout) for [requests](/up.request) in milliseconds.

    Set `undefined` to not use a timeout.

  @param {boolean|Function(up.Response): boolean} [config.fail]
    Whether Unpoly will consider a response to constitute a [failed response](/failed-responses).

    By default Unpoly will consider any status code other than HTTP 2xx or [304](/skipping-rendering#rendering-nothing) to represent a failed response.
    You may use this option to customize this behavior. For instance, you can fail a response if it contains a given header or body text.

    The following configuration will fail all responses with an `X-Unauthorized` header:

    ```js
    let badStatus = up.network.config.fail
    up.network.config.fail = (response) => badStatus(response) || response.header('X-Unauthorized')
    ```

    Also see [Customizing failure detection](/failed-responses#customizing-failure-detection).

  @param {number} [config.cacheExpireAge=15_000]
    The number of milliseconds after which a cache entry is considered [expired](/caching#expiration) and will trigger [revalidation](/caching#revalidation) when used.

    The configured age should at least cover the average time between [preloading](/preloading) and following a link.

    Defaults to 15 seconds.

  @param {number} [config.cacheEvictAge=90*60*1000]
    The number of milliseconds after which a cache entry is [evicted](/caching#eviction).

    In practice you will often prefer [*expiration*](/caching#expiration) over *eviction*.

    Defaults to 90 minutes.

  @param {Function(up.Request): boolean} [config.autoCache]
    Whether to [cache](/caching) the given request with `{ cache: 'auto' }`.

    By default Unpoly will auto-cache requests with [safe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP) HTTP methods like `GET`.

    You may change this default to prevent auto-caching of some of your routes. For example, this will prevent auto-caching
    of requests to URLs ending with `/edit`:

    ```js
    let defaultAutoCache = up.network.config.autoCache
    up.network.config.autoCache = function(request) {
      return defaultAutoCache(request) && !request.url.endsWith('/edit')
    }
    ```

  @param {Function(up.Request, up.Response | up.Offline): boolean|string} [config.expireCache]
    Whether to [expire](/caching#expiration) the [cache](/caching) after the given request and response.

    By default Unpoly will expire the entire cache after a request with an [unsafe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP) HTTP method.

    The configured function can either return a boolean or an [URL pattern](/url-patterns) matching responses that should be expired.

  @param {Function(up.Request, up.Response | up.Offline): boolean|string} [config.evictCache=false]
    Whether to [evict](/caching#eviction) the [cache](/caching) after the given request and response.

    The configured function can either return a boolean or an [URL pattern](/url-patterns) matching responses that should be evicted.

    By default Unpoly will *not* evict any cache entries when a request is made.

    For example, to evict the entire cache after a request with an [unsafe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP) HTTP method:

    ```js
    up.network.config.evictCache = (request) => !request.isSafe()
    ```

  @param {boolean|Function(): boolean} [config.progressBar]
    Whether to show a [progress bar](/loading-indicators#progress-bar)
    for [late requests](#config.badResponseTime).

  /*-
  Makes an AJAX request to the given URL.

  Returns an `up.Request` object which contains information about the request.
  This request object is also a promise for an `up.Response` that contains
  the response text, headers, etc.

  ### Example

  ```js
  let request = up.request('/search', { params: { query: 'sunshine' } })
  console.log('We made a request to', request.url)

  let response = await request
  console.log('The response text is', response.text)
  ```

  ### Error handling

  The returned promise will fulfill with an `up.Response` when the server
  responds with an HTTP status of 2xx (like `200`).

  When the server responds with an HTTP error code (like `422` or `500`), the promise
  will *reject* with `up.Response`.

  When the request fails from a fatal error (like a timeout or loss of connectivity),
  the promise will reject with an [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) object.

  Here is an example for a complete control flow that handles both HTTP error codes
  and fatal errors:

  ```js
  try {
    let response = await up.request('/search', { params: { query: 'sunshine' } })
    console.log('Successful response with text:', response.text)
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof up.Response) {
      console.log('Server responded with HTTP status %s and text %s', e.status, e.text)
    } else {
      console.log('Fatal error during request:', e.message)
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Caching

  You may [cache](/caching) responses by passing a `{ cache }` option. Responses for a cached
  request will resolve instantly.

  See [Caching](/caching) for more details and examples.

  @function up.request

  @param {string} [url]
    The requested URL.

    Instead of passing the URL as a string argument, you can also pass it as an `{ url }` option.

  @param {string} [options.url]
    The requested URL.

  @param {string} [options.method='GET']
    The HTTP method for the request.

  @param {Object|up.Params|FormData|string|Array} [options.params={}]
    [Parameters](/up.Params) that should be sent as the request's
    [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) or payload.

    When making a `GET` request to a URL with a query string, the given `{ params }` will be added
    to the query parameters.

  @param {boolean} [options.cache=false]
    Whether to read from and write to the [cache](/caching).

    With `{ cache: true }` Unpoly will try to re-use a cached response before connecting
    to the network. If no cached response exists, Unpoly will make a request and cache
    the server response.

    With `{ cache: 'auto' }` Unpoly will use the cache only if `up.network.config.autoCache`
    returns `true` for this request.

    With `{ cache: false }` (the default) Unpoly will always make a network request.

  @param {boolean|string} [options.expireCache]
    Whether to [expire](/caching#expiration) the [cache](/caching) after this request.

    Defaults to the result of `up.network.config.expireCache`, which
    defaults to expiring the entire cache after a non-GET request.

    You may also pass a [URL pattern](/url-patterns) to only expire matching responses.

  @param {boolean|string} [options.evictCache]
    Whether to [evict](/caching#eviction) the [cache](/caching) after this request.

    Defaults to the result of `up.network.config.evictCache`, which defaults to `false`.

    You may also pass a [URL pattern](/url-patterns) to only evict matching responses.

  @param {Object} [options.headers={}]
    An object of additional HTTP headers.

    Unpoly will by default send a number of custom request headers.
    See `up.protocol` for details.

  @param {boolean} [options.wrapMethod]
    Whether to wrap non-standard HTTP methods in a POST request.

    If this is set, methods other than GET and POST will be converted to a `POST` request
    and carry their original method as a `_method` parameter. This is to [prevent unexpected redirect behavior](https://makandracards.com/makandra/38347).

    Defaults to [`up.network.config`](/up.network.config#config.wrapMethod).

  @param {string} [options.timeout]
    A timeout in milliseconds.

    If the request is queued due to [many concurrent requests](/up.network.config#config.concurrency),
    the timeout will not include the time spent waiting in the queue.

  @param {string} [options.target='body']
    The CSS selector that will be sent as an `X-Up-Target` header.

    The targets of concurrent requests to to same URL [may be merged](/X-Up-Target#merging-of-request-targets).

  @param {string} [options.failTarget='body']
    The CSS selector that will be sent as an `X-Up-Fail-Target` header.

  @param {string} [options.layer='current']
    The [layer](/up.layer) this request is associated with.

    If this request is intended to update an existing fragment, this is that fragment's layer.

    If this request is intended to [open an overlay](/opening-overlays),
    the associated layer is the future overlay's parent layer.

  @param {string} [options.failLayer='current']
    The [layer](/up.layer) this request is associated with if the server [sends a HTTP status code](/failed-responses).

  @param {Element} [options.origin]
    The DOM element that caused this request to be sent, e.g. a hyperlink or form element.

  @param {Element} [options.contentType]
    The format in which to encode the request params.

    Allowed values are `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data`.
    Only `multipart/form-data` can transport binary data.

    If this option is omitted Unpoly will prefer `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,
    unless request params contains binary data.

  @param {string} [options.payload]
    A custom payload for this request.

    By default Unpoly will build a payload from the given `{ params }` option.
    Therefore this option is not required when making a standard link or form request to a server
    that renders HTML.

    A use case for this option is talking to a JSON API that expects requests with a `application/json` payload.

    If a `{ payload }` option is given you must also pass a `{ contentType }`.

  @param {boolean} [options.background=false]
    Whether this request will load in the background.

    Background requests deprioritized over foreground requests.
    Background requests also won't emit `up:network:late` events and won't trigger
    the [progress bar](/loading-indicators#progress-bar).

  @param {number} [options.badResponseTime]
    The number of milliseconds after which this request can cause
    an `up:network:late` event.

    Defaults to `up.network.config.badResponseTime`.

    @experimental

  @return {up.Request}
    An object with information about the request.

    The request object is also a promise for its `up.Response`.

  ### Effects of aborting

  When an `up.request()` is aborted, its returned promise rejects with an `up.AbortError`:

  ```js

    let response = await up.request('/path')
    console.log(response.text)
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof up.AbortError) {
      console.log('Request was aborted: ' + error.reason)
    }
  }
  ```

  Also the event `up:request:aborted` will be emitted.

  ### Aborting all requests

  Without arguments, this will abort all pending requests:

  ```js
  up.network.abort()
  ```

  ### Aborting a single request

  To abort a given `up.Request` object, pass it as the first argument:

  ```js
  let request = up.request('/path')
  up.network.abort(request)
  ```

  ### Aborting requests matching a pattern

  To abort all requests matching an [URL pattern](/url-patterns), pass it as the first argument:

  ```js
  up.network.abort('/path/*')
  ```

  ### Aborting requests matching an arbitrary condition

  To abort all requests matching an arbitrary condition, pass a function that takes a request
  and returns a boolean value. Unpoly will abort all request for which the given
  function returns `true`. E.g. to abort all requests with a HTTP method as `GET`:

  ```js
  up.network.abort((request) => request.method == 'GET')
  ```

  ### Aborting requests targeting a fragment or layer

  Use `up.fragment.abort()`.

  @function up.network.abort
  @param {string|Function(up.Request): boolean|up.Request|boolean} [condition=true]
    A condition that controls which requests to abort.

    If set to a string, it is interpreted as a [URL pattern](/url-patterns). All requests
    matching that pattern will be aborted.

    If set to an `up.Request` object, that one request is aborted.

    If set to a function, it will be called for each pending requests.
    All requests for which the function returns `true` will be aborted.

    If set to `true`, all pending requests are aborted.
  @param {string} [options.reason]
    A reason for why the request was aborted.

    If omitted, a generic reason like `"Aborted request to GET /path"` will be used.

    The reason will be set as the `up.AbortError`'s message.
  @param {up.Request} [options.except]
    An `up.Request` that should not be aborted even if it matches the given `condition`.
