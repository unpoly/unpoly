/*-
Network requests
================

Unpoly ships with an optimized HTTP client for fast and effective
communication with your server-side app.

While you can use the browser's native `fetch()` function,
Unpoly's `up.request()` has a number of convenience features:

- Requests may be [cached](/up.request#options.cache) to reuse responses and enable [preloading](/a-up-preload).
- Requests send [additional HTTP headers](/up.protocol) that the server may use to optimize its response.
  For example, when updating a [fragment](/up.fragment), the fragment's selector is automatically sent
  as an `X-Up-Target` header. The server may choose to only render the targeted fragment.
- Useful events like `up:request:loaded` or `up:request:late` are emitted throughout the request/response
  lifecycle.
- When too many requests are sent concurrently, excessive requests are [queued](/up.network.config#config.concurrency).
  This prevents exhausting the user's bandwidth and limits race conditions in end-to-end tests.
- A very concise API requiring zero boilerplate code.

@module up.network
*/
up.network = (function() {

  /*-
  Sets default options for this package.

  @property up.network.config

  @param {number} [config.concurrency=4]
    The maximum number of concurrently loading requests.

    Additional requests are queued. [Preload](/a-up-preload) requests are
    always queued behind non-preload requests.

    You might find it useful to set the request concurrency `1` in end-to-end tests
    to prevent race conditions.

    Note that your browser might impose its own request limit
    regardless of what you configure here.

  @param {boolean} [config.wrapMethod]
    Whether to wrap non-standard HTTP methods in a POST request.

    If this is set, methods other than GET and POST will be converted to a `POST` request
    and carry their original method as a `_method` parameter. This is to [prevent unexpected redirect behavior](https://makandracards.com/makandra/38347).

    If you disable method wrapping, make sure that your server always redirects with
    with a 303 status code (rather than 302).

  @param {number} [config.cacheSize=70]
    The maximum number of responses to cache.

    If the size is exceeded, the oldest responses will be dropped from the cache.

  @param {number} [config.cacheExpiry=300000]
    The number of milliseconds until a cached response expires.

    Defaults to 5 minutes.

  @param {number} [config.badDownlink=0.6]
    The connection's minimum effective bandwidth estimate required
    to prevent Unpoly from [reducing requests](/up.network.shouldReduceRequests).

    The value is given in megabits per second. Higher is better.

  @param {number} [config.badRTT=0.6]
    The connection's maximum effective round-trip time required
    to prevent Unpoly from [reducing requests](/up.network.shouldReduceRequests).

    The value is given in milliseconds. Lower is better.

  @param {number} [config.badResponseTime=400]
    How long the proxy waits until emitting the [`up:request:late` event](/up:request:late).

    Requests exceeding this response time will also cause a [progress bar](/up.network.config#config.progressBar)
    to appear at the top edge of the screen.

    This metric is *not* considered for the decision to
    [reduce requests](/up.network.shouldReduceRequests).

    The value is given in milliseconds.

  @param {boolean|Function(up.Response): boolean} [config.fail]
    Whether Unpoly will consider a response to constitute a [failed response](/failed-responses).

    By default Unpoly will consider any status code other than HTTP 2xx or 304 to represent a failed response.
    You may use this option to customize this behavior. For instance, you can fail a response if it contains a given header or body text.

    The following configuration will fail all responses with an `X-Unauthorized` header.

    ```js
    let badStatus = up.network.config.fail
    up.network.config.fail = (response) => badStatus(response) || response.getHeader('X-Unauthorized')
    ```

  @param {Function(up.Request): boolean} [config.autoCache]
    Whether to cache the given request with `{ cache: 'auto' }`.

    By default Unpoly will auto-cache requests with safe HTTP methods.

  @param {Function(up.Request, up.Response)} config.clearCache
    Whether to [clear the cache](/up.cache.clear) after the given request and response.

    By default Unpoly will clear the entire cache after a request with an unsafe HTTP method.

  @param {Array<string>|Function(up.Request): Array<string>} [config.requestMetaKeys]
    An array of request property names
    that are sent to the server as [HTTP headers](/up.protocol).

    The server may return an optimized response based on these properties,
    e.g. by omitting a navigation bar that is not targeted.

    ### Cacheability considerations

    Two requests with different `requestMetaKeys` are considered cache misses when [caching](/up.request) and
    [preloading](/a-up-preload). To **improve cacheability**, you may set
    `up.network.config.requestMetaKeys` to a shorter list of property keys.

    ### Available fields

    The default configuration is `['target', 'failTarget', 'mode', 'failMode', 'context', 'failContext']`.
    This means the following properties are sent to the server:

    | Request property         | Request header      |
    |--------------------------|---------------------|
    | `up.Request#target`      | `X-Up-Target`       |
    | `up.Request#failTarget`  | `X-Up-Fail-Target`  |
    | `up.Request#context`     | `X-Up-Context`      |
    | `up.Request#failContext` | `X-Up-Fail-Context` |
    | `up.Request#mode`        | `X-Up-Mode`         |
    | `up.Request#failMode`    | `X-Up-Fail-Mode`    |

    ### Per-route configuration

    You may also configure a function that accepts an [`up.Request`](/up.Request) and returns
    an array of request property names that are sent to the server.

    With this you may send different request properties for different URLs:

    ```javascript
    up.network.config.requestMetaKeys = function(request) {
      if (request.url == '/search') {
        // The server optimizes responses on the /search route.
        return ['target', 'failTarget']
      } else {
        // The server doesn't optimize any other route,
        // so configure maximum cacheability.
        return []
      }
    }
    ```

  @param {boolean|Function(): boolean} [config.progressBar]
    Whether to show a progress bar for [late requests](/up:request:late).

    The progress bar is implemented as a single `<up-progress-bar>` element.
    Unpoly will automatically insert and remove this element as requests
    are [late](/up:request:late) or [recovered](/up:request:recover).

    The default appearance is a simple blue bar at the top edge of the screen.
    You may customize the style using CSS:

    ```css
    up-progress-bar {
      background-color: red;
    }
    ```

  ### Other reasons the cache may clear

  By default Unpoly automatically clears the entire cache whenever it processes
  a request with an non-GET HTTP method. To customize this rule, use `up.network.config.clearCache`.

  The server may also clear the cache by sending an [`X-Up-Clear-Cache`](/X-Up-Clear-Cache) header.

  @function up.cache.clear

  /*-
  Makes an AJAX request to the given URL.

  Returns an `up.Request` object which contains information about the request.
  This request object is also a promise for an `up.Response` that contains
  the response text, headers, etc.

  ### Example

  ```js
  let request = up.request('/search', { params: { query: 'sunshine' } })
  console.log('We made a request to', request.url)

  let response = await request
  console.log('The response text is', response.text)
  ```

  ### Error handling

  The returned promise will fulfill with an `up.Response` when the server
  responds with an HTTP status of 2xx (like `200`).

  When the server responds with an HTTP error code (like `422` or `500`), the promise
  will *reject* with `up.Response`.

  When the request fails from a fatal error (like a timeout or loss of connectivity),
  the promise will reject with an [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) object.

  Here is an example for a complete control flow that handles both HTTP error codes
  and fatal errors:

  ```js
  try {
    let response = await up.request('/search', { params: { query: 'sunshine' } })
    console.log('Successful response with text:', response.text)
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof up.Response) {
      console.log('Server responded with HTTP status %s and text %s', e.status, e.text)
    } else {
      console.log('Fatal error during request:', e.message)
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Caching

  You may cache responses by passing a `{ cache }` option. Responses for a cached
  request will resolve instantly.

  By default the cache cleared after making a request with an unsafe HTTP method.

  You can configure caching with the [`up.network.config`](/up.network.config) property.

  @function up.request

  @param {string} [url]
    The URL for the request.

    Instead of passing the URL as a string argument, you can also pass it as an `{ url }` option.

  @param {string} [options.url]
    The URL for the request.

  @param {string} [options.method='GET']
    The HTTP method for the request.

  @param {Object|up.Params|string|Array} [options.params={}]
    [Parameters](/up.Params) that should be sent as the request's
    [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) or payload.

    When making a `GET` request to a URL with a query string, the given `{ params }` will be added
    to the query parameters.

  @param {boolean} [options.cache=false]
    Whether to read from and write to the [cache](/up.request#caching).

    With `{ cache: true }` Unpoly will try to re-use a cached response before connecting
    to the network. If no cached response exists, Unpoly will make a request and cache
    the server response.

    With `{ cache: 'auto' }` Unpoly will use the cache only if `up.network.config.autoCache`
    returns `true` for this request.

    With `{ cache: false }` (the default) Unpoly will always make a network request.

  @param {boolean|string} [options.clearCache]
    Whether to [clear](/up.cache.clear) the [cache](/up.cache.get) after this request.

    Defaults to the result of `up.network.config.clearCache`, which
    defaults to clearing the entire cache after a non-GET request.

    You may also pass a [URL pattern](/url-patterns) to only uncache matching responses.

  @param {Object} [options.headers={}]
    An object of additional HTTP headers.

    Note that Unpoly will by default send a number of custom request headers.
    See `up.protocol` and `up.network.config.requestMetaKeys` for details.

  @param {boolean} [options.wrapMethod]
    Whether to wrap non-standard HTTP methods in a POST request.

    If this is set, methods other than GET and POST will be converted to a `POST` request
    and carry their original method as a `_method` parameter. This is to [prevent unexpected redirect behavior](https://makandracards.com/makandra/38347).

    Defaults to [`up.network.config`](/up.network.config#config.wrapMethod).

  @param {string} [options.timeout]
    A timeout in milliseconds.

    If the request is queued due to [many concurrent requests](/up.network.config#config.concurrency),
    the timeout will not include the time spent waiting in the queue.

  @param {string} [options.target='body']
    The CSS selector that will be sent as an `X-Up-Target` header.

  @param {string} [options.failTarget='body']
    The CSS selector that will be sent as an `X-Up-Fail-Target` header.

  @param {string} [options.layer='current']
    The [layer](/up.layer) this request is associated with.

    If this request is intended to update an existing fragment, this is that fragment's layer.

    If this request is intended to [open an overlay](/opening-overlays),
    the associated layer is the future overlay's parent layer.

  @param {string} [options.failLayer='current']
    The [layer](/up.layer) this request is associated with if the server [sends a HTTP status code](/failed-responses).

  @param {Element} [options.origin]
    The DOM element that caused this request to be sent, e.g. a hyperlink or form element.

  @param {Element} [options.contentType]
    The format in which to encode the request params.

    Allowed values are `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data`.
    Only `multipart/form-data` can transport binary data.

    If this option is omitted Unpoly will prefer `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,
    unless request params contains binary data.

  @param {string} [options.payload]
    A custom payload for this request.

    By default Unpoly will build a payload from the given `{ params }` option.
    Therefore this option is not required when making a standard link or form request to a server
    that renders HTML.

    A use case for this option is talking to a JSON API that expects requests with a `application/json` payload.

    If a `{ payload }` option is given you must also pass a `{ contentType }`.

  @return {up.Request}
    An object with information about the request.

    The request object is also a promise for its `up.Response`.

  ### Effects of aborting

  When an `up.request()` is aborted, its returned promise rejects with an exception named `AbortError`:

  ```js
  try {
    let response = await up.request('/path')
    console.log(response.text)
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name == 'AbortError') {
      console.log('Request was aborted: ' + error.reason)
    }
  }
  ```

  Also the event `up:request:aborted` will be emitted.

  ### Aborting all requests

  Without arguments, this will abort all pending requests:

  ```js
  up.network.abort()
  ```

  ### Aborting a single request

  To abort a given `up.Request` object, pass it as the first argument:

  ```js
  let request = up.request('/path')
  up.network.abort(request)
  ```

  ### Aborting requests matching a pattern

  To abort all requests matching an [URL pattern](/url-pattern), pass it as the first argument:

  ```js
  up.network.abort('/path/*')
  ```

  ### Aborting requests matching an arbitrary condition

  To abort all requests matching an arbitrary condition, pass a function that takes a request
  and returns a boolean value. Unpoly will abort all request for which the given
  function returns `true`. E.g. to abort all requests with a HTTP method as `GET`:

  ```js
  up.network.abort((request) => request.method == 'GET')
  ```

  ### Aborting requests targeting a fragment or layer

  Use `up.fragment.abort()`.

  @function up.network.abort
  @param {up.Request|boolean|Function(up.Request|string): boolean} [condition=true]
    Which requests to abort.

    If this argument is omitted, all pending requests are aborted.
  @param {string} [options.reason='Request was aborted']
    A reason for why the request was aborted.

    The reason will be set as the `AbortError`'s message.
  @param {up.Request} [options.except]
    An `up.Request` that should not be aborted even if it matches the given `condition`.

  The event is emitted on the layer that caused the request.

  Also see `up:fragment:aborted`.

  @event up:request:aborted

  @param {up.Request} event.request
    The aborted request.

  @param {up.Layer} [event.layer]
    The [layer](/up.layer) this request is associated with.

    If this request was intended to update an existing fragment, this is that fragment's layer.

    If this request was intended to [open an overlay](/opening-overlays),
    the associated layer is the future overlay's parent layer.

  @param {Element} [event.origin]
    The link or form element that caused the request.

  @param event.preventDefault()

  This event is [emitted](/up.emit) when [AJAX requests](/up.request)
  are taking long to finish.

  By default Unpoly will wait 400 ms for an AJAX request to finish
  before emitting `up:request:late`. You may configure this delay like this:

  ```js
  up.network.config.badResponseTime = 1000 // milliseconds
  ```

  Once all responses have been received, an [`up:request:recover`](/up:request:recover)
  will be emitted.

  Note that if additional requests are made while Unpoly is already busy
  waiting, **no** additional `up:request:late` events will be triggered.

  ### Loading indicators

  By default the `up:request:late` event will cause a [progress bar](/up.network.config#config.progressBar)
  to appear at the top edge of the screen.

  If you don't like the default progress bar, you can [listen](/up.on) to the `up:request:late`
  and [`up:request:recover`](/up:request:recover) events to implement a custom
  loading indicator that appears during long-running requests.

  To build a custom loading indicator, please an element like this in your application layout:

  ```html
  <loading-indicator>Please wait!</loading-indicator>
  ```

  Now add a [compiler](/up.compiler) that hides the `<loading-indicator>` element
  while there are no long-running requests:

  ```js
  // Disable the default progress bar
  up.network.config.progressBar = false

  up.compiler('loading-indicator', function(indicator) {
    function show() { up.element.show(indicator) }
    function hide() { up.element.hide(indicator) }

    hide()

    return [
      up.on('up:request:late', show),
      up.on('up:request:recover', hide)
    ]
  })
  ```
