Caching
=======

Unpoly caches responses, allowing instant access to pages that the user has already visited this session.

To ensure that the user never sees stale content, cached content is [revalidated with the server](#revalidation).

Cached pages also [remain accessible](/network-issues#offline-cache) after a [disconnect](/network-issues#disconnects).


Enabling caching {#enabling}
----------------

You can enable caching with `{ cache: 'auto' }`, which caches all responses to GET requests.
You can configure this default:

```js
up.network.config.autoCache = (request) => request.method === 'GET'
```

When [navigating](/navigation) the `{ cache: 'auto' }` option is already set by [default](/up.fragment.config#config.navigateOptions).

To force caching regardless of HTTP method, pass `{ cache: true }`.


Disabling caching {#disabling}
-----------------

You can disable the caching mechanism globally or selectively.

### Disabling the cache globally {#diabling-globally} 

[Navigation](/navigation) is the only moment when Unpoly caches by default.

You can disable caching globally like so:

```js
up.fragment.config.navigateOptions.cache = false
```

### Disabling the cache for selected routes {#disabling-route}

If you want to keep the navigation default, but disable auto-caching for some URLs, configure `up.network.config.autoCache`: 

```js
let defaultAutoCache = up.network.config.autoCache
up.network.config.autoCache = function(request) {
  defaultAutoCache(request) && !request.url.endsWith('/edit')
}
```

### Disabling the cache for a link {#disabling-link}

If you want to keep the default, but disable caching for an individual link, use an `[up-cache=false]` attribute:

```html
<a href="/stock-charts" up-cache="false">View latest prices</a>
```

### Disabling the cache for a function call {#disabling-function-call}

If you want to keep the default, but disable caching for a function call that would otherwise navigate,
pass an `{ cache: false }` option:

```js
up.follow(link, { cache: false })
```


Revalidation
------------

Cache entries are only considered *fresh* for [15 seconds](/up.network.config#config.cacheExpireAge). When rendering older cache content, Unpoly automatically reloads the fragment to ensure that the user never sees expired content. This process is called *cache revalidation*.

When re-visiting pages, Unpoly often renders twice:

1. An initial render pass from the cache (which may be expired)
2. A second render pass from the server (which is always fresh)

This has some benefits:

- Because we revalidate cached content, the user always sees fresh content. E.g. if another user has added an item to a list that we have cached, we will see that new item after revalidation.
- We can have long cache eviction times, allowing instant navigation for 90 minutes, even when offline or on a flaky connection.
- We no longer need to clear the cache after a form submission. We just mark all cache entries as stale.

> [note]
> Revalidation only happens after expired content was rendered into the page.
> No revalidation occurs when expired cache entries are accessed without rendering (e. g. when [preloading](/preloading) a cached URL).



### When nothing changed

Your server-side app is not required to re-render a request if there are no changes to the cached content.

By supporting [conditional HTTP requests](/conditional-requests) you can quickly produce an empty revalidation response for unchanged content.


### Preventing rendering of revalidation responses

To discard revalidated HTML *after* the server has responded, you may prevent the
`up:fragment:loaded` event when it has an `{ revalidating: true }` property.
This gives you a chance to inspect the response or DOM state right before a fragment would be inserted:

```js
up.on('up:fragment:loaded', function(event) {
  // Don't insert fresh content if the user has started a video
  // after the expired content was rendered.
  if (event.revalidating && !event.request.fragment.querySelector('video')?.paused) {
    // Finish the render pass with no changes.
    event.skip()
  }
})
```

See [skipping unnecessary rendering](/skipping-rendering) for more details and examples.


### Detecting revalidation from a compiler

Compilers with side effects may occasionally want to behave differently when the compiled element is being
reloaded for the purpose of cache revalidation.

To detect revalidation, compilers may accept a third argument with information about the current [render pass](/up.render).
In the example below a compiler wants to [track a page view](/analytics) in a web analytics tool:

```js
up.compiler('[track-page-view]', function(element, data, meta) { // mark-phrase "meta"
  // Don't track duplicate page views if we just reloaded for cache revalidation. 
  if (!meta.revalidating) {
    // Send an event to our web analytics tool.
    trackPageView(meta.layer.location)
  }
})
```


### Enabling revalidation

When [navigating](/navigation), revalidation is enabled by default.

When not navigating, you can enable revalidation by setting an `[up-revalidate="auto"]` attribute or passing an `{ revalidate: 'auto' }` option.
This revalidates only [expired](/up.network.config#config.cacheExpireAge) cache entries. You can configure this default:

```js
up.network.config.cacheExpireAge = 20_000 // expire after 20 seconds
up.fragment.config.autoRevalidate = (response) => response.expired
```

To force revalidation regardless of cache age, pass `{ revalidate: true }`.


### Disabling revalidation

[Navigation](/navigation) is the only moment when Unpoly revalidates by default.
You can disable cache revalidation while navigating like so:

```js
up.fragment.config.navigateOptions.revalidate = false
```

If you want to keep the navigation default, but disable revalidation for some responses, configure `up.fragment.config.autoRevalidate`:

```js
up.fragment.config.autoRevalidate = (response) => response.expired && response.url != '/dashboard'
```

If you want to keep the default, but disable caching for an individual link, use an `[up-revalidate=false]` attribute:

```html
<a href="/" up-revalidate="false">Start page</a>
```

If you want to keep the default, but disable revalidation for a function call that would otherwise navigate,
pass an `{ revalidate: false }` option:

```js
up.follow(link, { cache: true, revalidate: false })
```



Expiration
----------

Cached content automatically expires after 15 seconds. This can be configured in `up.network.config.cacheExpireAge`. The configured age should at least cover the average time between [preloading](/preloading) and following a link.

After expiring, cached content is kept in the cache, but will trigger [revalidation](#revalidation) when used. Expired pages also [remain accessible](/network-issues#offline-cache) after a [connection loss](/network-issues#disconnects).


### Expiring content after an interaction

`GET` requests don't expire any content by default. When the user makes a non-`GET` request (usually a form submission with `POST`), the *entire cache* is expired. The assumption here is that a non-GET request will change data on the server, so all cache entries should be [revalidated](#revalidation).

There are multiple ways to override this behavior:

- Configure which requests should cause expiration in `up.network.config.expireCache`
- Pass an [`{ expireCache }`](/up.render#options.expireCache) option to the rendering function
- Set an [`[up-expire-cache]`](/up.render#options.expireCache) attribute on a link or form
- Send an `X-Up-Expire-Cache` response header from the server
- Imperatively expire cache entries through the `up.cache.expire()` function


Eviction
--------

Instead of expiring content you may also *evict* content to erase it from the cache.

In practice you will often prefer *expiration* over *eviction*. Expired content remains available during a connection loss and for instant navigation, while [revalidation](#revalidation) ensures the user always sees a fresh revision. Evicted content on the other hand is gone from the cache entirely, and a new network request is needed to access it again.

### Evicting content after an interaction

One use case for eviction is when it is not acceptable for the user to see a brief flash of stale content before [revalidation](#revalidation) finishes. You can do so in multiple ways:

- Configure which requests should cause eviction in `up.network.config.evictCache`
- Pass an [`{ evictCache }`](/up.render#options.evictCache) option to the rendering function
- Set an [`[up-evict-cache]`](/up.render#options.evictCache) attribute on a link or form
- Send an `X-Up-Evict-Cache` response header from the server
- Imperatively evict cache entries through the `up.cache.evict()` function

### Capping memory usage

To limit the memory required to hold its cache, Unpoly evicts cached content in the following ways:

- Unpoly evicts cache entries after 90 minutes. This can be configured in `up.network.config.cacheEvictAge`.
- The cache holds up to 70 responses. When this limit is reached, the oldest responses are evicted. This can be configured in `up.network.config.cacheSize`.


Caching optimized responses
---------------------------

Servers may inspect [request headers](/up.protocol) to [optimize responses](/optimizing-responses),
e.g. by omitting a navigation bar that is not targeted.

Request headers that influenced a response should be listed in a `Vary` response header.
This tells Unpoly to partition its cache for that URL so that each
request header value gets a separate cache entries.

### Example

@include vary-header-example


### How cache entries are matched

By default cached responses will match all requests to the same URL.

When a response has a `Vary` header, matching requests must additionally have the same values for all listed headers:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th class="split-table-head">
    </th>
    <th>
      🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .foo</code><br>
      🠤 <code>Vary: X-Up-Target</code>
    </th>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .foo</code></th>
    <td>✔️ cache hit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .bar</code></th>
    <td>❌ cache miss</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <i>No <code autolink="false">X-Up-Target</code></i></th>
    <td>❌ cache miss</td>
  </tr>
</table>


When a response has *no* `Vary` header, that response is a cache hit for <i>all</i> requests to the URL, regardless of target:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th class="split-table-head">
    </th>
    <th>
      🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .foo</code><br>
      🠤 <i>No <code autolink="false">Vary</code></i>
    </th>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .foo</code></th>
    <td>✔️ cache hit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .bar</code></th>
    <td>✔️ cache hit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <i>No <code autolink="false">X-Up-Target</code></i></th>
    <td>✔️ cache hit</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Requests can [target multiple fragments](/targeting-fragments#multiple) by separating selectors
with a comma. If the server replies with `Vary: X-Up-Target`, that response is a cache hit for each individual selector:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th class="split-table-head">
    </th>
    <th>
      🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .foo, .bar</code><br>
      🠤 <code>Vary: X-Up-Target</code>
    </th>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .foo</code></th>
    <td>✔️ cache hit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .bar</code></th>
    <td>✔️ cache hit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .foo, .bar</code></th>
    <td>✔️ cache hit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .bar, .foo</code></th>
    <td>✔️ cache hit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .baz</code></th>
    <td>❌ cache miss</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <code>X-Up-Target: .foo, .baz</code></th>
    <td>❌ cache miss</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>🠦 <i>No <code autolink="false">X-Up-Target</code></i></th>
    <td>❌ cache miss</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Caching after redirects
-----------------------

- When a request `GET /foo` redirects to `GET /bar`, the response to `/bar` will be cached for both `GET /foo/` and `GET /bar`.
- For technical reasons Unpoly cannot read from the cache when an request to an uncached URL redirects to a cached URL.
  For example, when a form submission makes a request to `POST /action`, and the response redirects to `GET /path`,
  the browser will make a fresh request to `GET /path` even if `GET /path` was cached before.
- For technical reason Unpoly cannot detect redirects to the same URL, but using a different method. For example, when a request
  to `POST /users` redirects to `GET /users`. You can address this by including an `X-Up-Method` header in your responses.
