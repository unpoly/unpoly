Showing loading state
=====================

After a user interaction, Unpoly offers many methods to provide instant feedback while waiting for the network.

This increases the perceived responsiveness of your application.


Styling active elements
-----------------------

(There is an example on up.feedback)

- Links with .up-active
- Forms with .up-active (form, origin element, submit button)
- Targeted element gets .up-loading


Showing placeholders
--------------------

- Example
- See /placeholders



Arbitrary status effects
------------------------

You can do arbitrary status effects or event optimistic rendering.

Use previews.



Disabling forms while working
------------------------------

- Both feedback and a safeguard against concurrent input.



Global progress bar
-------------------

- Built-in progress bar
- Custom progress bars possible


Signaling severe network problems
---------------------------------

- up:fragment:offline
