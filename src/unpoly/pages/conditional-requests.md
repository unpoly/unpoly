Conditional requests
====================

*Conditional requests* is an HTTP feature that lets a client request content that is newer than a known modification time, or different from a known content hash.

Unpoly uses conditional requests for [reloading](/up.reload), [cache revalidation](/caching#revalidation) and [polling](/up-poll).
By observing HTTP headers, your server can quickly produce an empty response for unchanged content.
This saves CPU time and reduces the bandwidth cost for a
request/response exchange to about 1 KB.

> [IMPORTANT]
> Supporting conditional requests is entirely optional.
> If your backend does not honor conditional request headers, can still use features like [polling](/up-poll) or [cache revalidation](/caching#revalidation).


## Requesting content changed from a known content hash {#etag-condition}

In this example the browser updates a fragment with a [target](/targeting-fragments) from a URL `/messages`. For this it makes the following HTTP request:

```http
GET /messages HTTP/1.1
X-Up-Target: .messages
```

The server responds with both the content and a hash over the underlying data. The hash can be any string that identifies the rendered objects, revision and representation. Here is an example response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "x234dff"

<html>
  ...
  <div class='messages'>
    ...
  </div>
  ...  
</html>
```

> [NOTE]
> The double quotes are part of the [ETag's format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag).

After rendering, Unpoly remembers the `ETag` headers in an `[up-etag]` attribute:

```html
<div class='messages' up-etag='"x234dff"'>
...
</div>
```

When Unpoly [reloads](/up.reload), [revalidates](/caching#revalidation) or [polls](/up-poll) the fragment, it echoes the earlier content hash in an `If-None-Match` header:

```http
GET /messages HTTP/1.1
If-None-Match: "x234dff"
```

The server can compare the ETag from the request with the ETag of the underlying data.
If no more recent data is available, the server can skip rendering and
respond with `304 Not Modified`. No response body is required.

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

> [tip]
> Many web servers will automatically add a default `ETag` to your response, by hashing the response body.
> With this, identical HTML will result in a short `304 Not Modified` response.



## Requesting content newer than a known modification time {#time-condition}

In this example the browser updates a fragment with a [target](/targeting-fragments) from a URL `/messages`. For this it makes the following HTTP request:

```http
GET /messages HTTP/1.1
X-Up-Target: .messages
```

The server responds with both the content and its last modification time. The modification time can be any update timestamp for the data that was rendered. It should be sent as an `Last-Modified` header:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Nov 2000 13:11:22 GMT

<html>
  <div class='messages'>...</div>
</html>
```

After rendering, Unpoly remembers the `Last-Modified` header in an `[up-time]` attribute:

```html
<div class='messages' up-time='Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT'>
...
</div>
```

When Unpoly [reloads](/up.reload), [revalidates](/caching#revalidation) or [polls](/up-poll) the fragment, it echoes the earlier modification time in an `If-Modified-Since` header:

```http
GET /messages HTTP/1.1
If-Modified-Since: Wed, 15 Nov 2000 13:11:22 GMT
```

The server can compare the time from the request with the time of the last data update.
If no more recent data is available, the server can skip rendering and
respond with `304 Not Modified`. No response body is required.

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```


## Modification time or content hash?

Servers can use both `Last-Modified` and `ETag`, but `ETag` always takes precedence.

It's easier to mix in additional data into an `ETag`, e.g. the ID of the logged in user or the currently deployed commit hash.


## Individual versions per fragment {#fragment-versions}

A large response may contain multiple fragments that are later reloaded individually
and should each have their own ETag or modification time. In this case the server may render each fragment
with its own `[up-etag]` or `[up-time]` attribute:

```html
<div class='messages' up-time='Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT'>
  <div class='message' id='message1'>...</div>
  <div class='message' id='message2'>...</div>
</div>

<div class='recent-posts' up-time='Thu, 3 Nov 2022 15:35:02 GMT'>
  <div class='post' id='post1'>...</div>
  <div class='post' id='post2'>...</div>
</div>
```

When a fragment is reloaded Unpoly will use the version from the [closest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest)
`[up-etag]` or `[up-time]` attribute:

```js
up.reload('.messages')     // If-Modified-Since: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT
up.reload('.recent-posts') // If-Modified-Since: Thu, 3 Nov 2022 15:35:02 GMT
up.reload('#post1')        // If-Modified-Since: Thu, 3 Nov 2022 15:35:02 GMT
```

The server may send additional `ETag` or `Last-Modified` response headers. However this is optional and will only be used for fragments that don't have a close `[up-etag]` or `[up-time]` attribute.


## Removing versions for a fragment

To prevent a fragment from inheriting a version from an ancestor, assign it an `[up-etag=false]` or `[up-time=false]` attribute.
