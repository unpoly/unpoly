Handling server errors
======================

You may pass different render options for server responses with an error code.

Any HTTP status code other than 2xx is considered an error code.

A common use case for this is [form submissions](/up.form), where a successful response
should display a follow-up screen, but a failed response should re-render the form
or display errors.

## Rendering failed responses differently

To use a different [render option](/up.render) for a failed server response,
prefix the option with `fail`:

```js
up.render({
  url: '/action',
  method: 'post',
  target: '.content',   // when submission succeeds update '.content'
  failTarget: 'form',   // when submission fails update the form
  scroll: 'auto',       // when submission succeeds use default scroll behavior
  failScroll: '.errors' // when submission fails scroll to the error messages
})
```

When using Unpoly's HTML attributes with [links](/up.link) or [forms](/up.form)
you may infix an attribute with `fail`:

```html
<form method="post" action="/action"
  up-target=".content"
  up-fail-target="form"
  up-scroll="auto"
  up-fail-scroll=".errors">
  ...
</form>
```

Options that are used before the request is made (like `{ url, method, confirm }`) do not
have a `fail`-prefixed variant. Some options (like `{ history, fallback }`) are used for both
successful and failed responses, but may be overriden with a fail-prefixed variant
(e.g. `{ history: true, failHistory: false }`. Options related to layers, scrolling or
focus are never shared.

### Local content cannot fail

When the updated fragment content is not requested from a `{ url }`, but rather passed as a
HTML string, the update is always considered successful.

### Ignoring HTTP error codes

The `{ fail }` option or `[up-fail]` attribute changes how Unpoly determines whether a
server response was successful.
By default (`{ fail: 'auto' }`) any HTTP 2xx status code will be considered successful,
and any other status code will be considered failed.

You may also pass `{ fail: false }` or `[up-fail=false]` to always consider the response
to be successful, even with a HTTP 4xx or 5xx status code.

## Handling other types of failure

### Fatal network errors

When a request encounters fatal error like a timeout or loss of network connectivity, Unpoly
will emit `up:request:fatal` and not render.

### Aborted requests

When a request was aborted, Unpoly will emit `up:request:aborted` and not render.

### Unexpected content

A server might sometimes respond with unexpected content, like a maintenance page or a
login form.

To handle these cases, see `up:fragment:loaded`.
