Preloading links
================

You can preload links in advance.
When a preloaded link is clicked the response will already be [cached](/caching),
making the interaction feel instant.

[Eager preloading](/#on-insert) may also be used to populate the cache and keep
links [accessible while offline](/network-issues#offline-cache).


Preloading on hover {#on-hover}
-------------------

To preload a link when the user [hovers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseover_event)
over it, set an [`[up-preload]`](/a-up-preload) attribute:

```html
<a href="/path" up-preload>Hover over me to preload my content</a>
 ```

By default Unpoly will wait for 90 milliseconds of hovering before making the preload request.
This prevents accidental preloading when mouse moves over the link with no intention to click it.

The delay can be controlled by setting an [`[up-preload-delay]`](/a-up-preload#up-preload-delay) attribute
or configuring `up.link.config.preloadDelay`. Increasing the delay will lower the load in your server,
but will also make the interaction feel less instant.

On touch devices preloading will begin when the user places her finger on the link.

To [preload all links on hover](/handling-everything#preloading-all-links), configure `up.link.config.preloadSelectors`.


Eager preloading on insertion {#on-insert} 
----------------------------

To preload a link as soon as it appears in the DOM, set an [`[up-load-on="insert"]`](/a-up-preload#up-load-on) attribute.

This is useful for links with a high probability of being clicked, like a navigation menu:

```html
<a href="/menu" up-layer="new drawer" up-preload up-load-on="insert">â‰¡ Menu</a> <!-- mark-phrase "up-preload" -->
```

When an eagerly preloaded fragment is rendered multiple times, only a single request is made.
All subsequent render passes will render from the [cache](/caching).


Preloading when a link becomes visible {#on-reveal}
------------------------------------------

To "lazy preload" a link when it is scrolled into the [viewport](/up-viewport),
set an [`[up-load-on="reveal"]`](/a-up-preload#up-load-on) attribute.

This is useful when an element is [below the fold](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/below-the-fold/)
and is unlikely to be clicked until the the user scrolls:

```html
<a href="/stories/106" up-preload up-load-on="reveal">Full story</a> <!-- mark-phrase "reveal" -->
```

When a lazy preloading link enters and exit its viewport repeatedly, only a single request is made.



Controlling the load timing with JavaScript {#scripted}
-------------------------------------------------------

To programmatically preload any link element at a time of your choosing, use the `up.link.preload()` function:

```js
up.compiler('link[rel=next]', (link) => up.link.preload(link))
```

A link that is preloaded in that fashion does not require an `[up-preload]` attribute.


### Preloading a URL

To preload a given URL without a link element, you can make a [background](/up.render#options.background) request that [caches](/caching):

```js
up.request('/menu', { cache: true, background: true })
```


Preload request behavior
------------------------

Requests sent when preloading behave somewhat different to requests sent when following a link directly: 

- Preloading will not change elements ("render").
- Preloading a link will *not* [abort](/aborting-requests) pending requests
  [targeting](/targeting-fragments) the same fragments. Only when the link is clicked later
  conflicting requests are aborted.
- Preload requests are considered [background requests](/up.render#options.background)
  and will not show the [progress bar](/loading-indicators#progress-bar).
- Preloaded content is placed into the [cache](/caching) automatically.
- When a link destination is already cached, preloading will *not* make another request, even if the cache entry is [expired](/caching#expiration).
  When the link is clicked and the cached content is rendered into page, the fragment will be [revalidated](/caching#revalidation)
  if the cache entry is expired.
   


Events
------

When a link is preloaded via the `[up-preload]` attribute or `up.link.preload()` function, an `up:link:preload` event
is emitted.

The event can be prevented to stop the preload from taking place:

```js
function isSlowConnection() {
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation
  return navigator.connection && navigator.connection.effectiveType.include('2g')  
}


up.on('up:link:preload', function(event) {
  if (isSlowConnection()) {
    event.preventDefault()
  }
})
```
