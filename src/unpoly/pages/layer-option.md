Layer option
============

Unpoly lets you stack multiple screens in [layers](/up.layer).
Layers are *isolated*, meaning that you cannot accidentally match a fragment in another layer.

Most Unpoly features accept a `{ layer }` option or `[up-layer]` attribute to indicate
the layer in which a fragment should be rendered or in which a CSS selector should match elements.
Elements in other layers are ignored.

### The default

When no `{ layer }` option or `[up-layer]` attribute is given, Unpoly will generally
match in the [current layer](/up.layer.current).

The one exception is that when a DOM element is passed as `{ target }` or `{ origin }` option,
Unpoly will use that element's layer. Clicking an Unpoly-enabled [link](/up-follow) or
[form](/up-submit) will automatically set that link or form as the `{ origin }`.

### Disabling layer isolation

To disable layer isolation and match elements in *any* layer, pass `{ layer: 'any' }`.

### Matching the root layer

To match within the [root layer](/up.layer.root), pass `{ layer: 'root' }`.

### Matching any overlay

To match within any layer that is not the root layer, pass `{ layer: 'overlay' }`.

### Matching the current or frontmost layer

To match within the [current layer](/up.layer.current),
either omit the `{ layer }` option or explictely pass `{ layer: 'current' }`.

You may also explicitly target the [frontmost layer](/up.layer.front) by passing `{ layer: 'front' }`.

Most of the time, the *current* and *frontmost* layer both refer to the last layer
in the layer stack. There are however some cases where the current layer is a layer in the background:

- While an element in a background layer is being [compiled](/up.compiler).
- While an Unpoly event like `up:request:loaded` is being triggered from a background layer.
- While an event listener bound to a background layer using `up.Layer#on()` is being called.

### Matching relative to the current layer

You may use common tree terminology to match a layer relative to the current layer:

| Option       | Description                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `parent`     | The layer that opened the current layer                     |
| `closest`    | The current layer or any ancestor, preferring closer layers |
| `overlay`    | Any overlay                                                 |
| `ancestor`   | Any ancestor layer of the current layer                     |
| `child`      | The child layer of the current layer                        |
| `descendant` | Any descendant of the current layer                         |
| `subtree`    | The current layer and its descendants                       |

### Matching the layer of a given element

When a DOM element is passed as `{ target }` or `{ origin }` option,
Unpoly will use that element's layer.

Clicking an Unpoly-enabled [link](/up-follow) or
[form](/up-submit) will automatically set that link or form as the `{ origin }`.

### Matching a layer by index

Pass a number to match within a layer with that index.

Layers are counted from the root layer upwards. Therefore `{ layer: 0 }` matches
within the root layer. `{ layer: 1 }` would match within the first overlay.

### Using a layer reference

Functions like `up.layer.get()` or `up.layer.current` return an `up.Layer` instance
that you can later pass as a `{ layer }` option.

This is useful for async code where the "current" layer may change over time:

```js
// Store an up.Layer reference to what is now the current layer.
let layerReference = up.layer.current

// Run a function in 10 seconds layer.
setTimeout(function() {
  // Pass the saved layer reference since the current layer
  // may have changed in the last 10 seconds..
  let headlines = up.fragment.get('h1', { layer: layerReference })
  console.log("Headlines are ", headlines)
}, 10000)
```

### Matching in multiple layers

You can pass more than one layer reference as an array of options.
Alternatively you may pass a a string of layer names separated by a space character or an `or` delimiter.

For example `{ layer: 'current or parent' }` would match in either the current layer or the parent layer.

If layers in the given list don't exist they will be ignored. For example, `'parent or root'` would first try
to match within a parent layer. If there is no parent layer (because we're already in the root layer),
Unpoly will match within the root layer.


### Opening new layers

You may render a fragment in a new overlay by passing `{ layer: 'new' }`.

See [opening overlays](/opening-overlays) for details.


### Targeting another layer for server errors

Like most render options, `{ layer }` and `[up-layer]` indicate which layer
to update in case of a successful server response.

To set the layer when the [server responds with an error code](/failed-responses),
use `{ failLayer }` or `[up-fail-layer]`.
