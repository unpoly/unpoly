/*-
Instances of `up.RenderResult` describe the effects of [rendering](/up.render).

Functions like `up.render()`, `up.follow()` or `up.submit()` return a promise
that resolve with an `up.RenderResult`:

```js
let result = await up.render('.target', content: 'foo')
console.log(result.fragments) // => [<div class="target">...</div>]
console.log(result.layer)     // => up.Layer.Root
```

@class up.RenderResult
@parent up.fragment
*/
up.RenderResult = class RenderResult extends up.Record {

  /*-
  An array of fragments that were inserted.

  @property up.RenderResult#fragments
  @param {Array<Element>} fragments
  @stable
  */

  /*-
  The updated [layer](/up.layer).

  @property up.RenderResult#layer
  @param {up.Layer} layer
  @stable
  */

  /*-
  The [target selector](/targeting-fragments) that was rendered.

  @property up.RenderResult#target
  @param {string} target
  @stable
  */

  /*-
  The effective [render](/up.render) options used to produce this result.

  If this result was produced from a [failed response](/failed-response),
  [`fail` prefixes](/failed-response#rendering-failed-responses-differently)
  have been removed from the render options.

  @property up.RenderResult#options

  /*-
  A promise that settles when no further DOM changes will be caused by this render pass.

  In particular:

  - [Animations](/up.motion) have concluded and [transitioned](/up-transition) elements were removed from the DOM tree.
  - A [cached response](#options.cache) was [revalidated with the server](/caching#revalidation).
    If the server has responded with new content, this content has also been rendered.

  The promise resolves to the last `up.RenderResult` that updated a fragment.
  If [revalidation](/caching#revalidation) re-rendered the fragment, it is the result from the
  second render pass. If no revalidation was performed, or if revalidation yielded an [empty response](/caching#when-nothing-changed),
  it is the result from the initial render pass.

  The promise will reject if the server sends an error status,
  if there is a network issue, or if targets could not be matched.

  Also see [Awaiting postprocessing](/render-lifecycle#awaiting-postprocessing).

  ### Example

  ```js
  let result = await up.render({ url: '/path' }).finished
  console.log(result.fragments)

  @property up.RenderResult#finished
  @param {Promise<up.RenderResult>}
  ```

  /*-
  Whether this render pass did not result in any fragments being rendered.

  There are some cases where we did not render any fragment:

  - Server sent HTTP status `304 Not Modified` to [avoid re-rendering unchanged content](/skipping-rendering).
  - Server sent HTTP status `204 No Content`.
  - The target selector was set to `':none'` by either client or server.
  - The server sent an `X-Up-Accept-Layer` or `X-Up-Dismiss-Layer` header.
    This [closes an overlay](/closing-overlays#closing-from-the-server) before content is rendered.
