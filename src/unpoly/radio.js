    An array of CSS selectors that is replaced whenever a matching element is found in a response.
    These elements are replaced even when they were not targeted directly.

    By default this contains the `[up-hungry]` attribute.

    The configured selectors will be used to find hungry elements in the current page.

    specific element. E.g. when you configure `up.radio.config.hungrySelectors.push('input')`,
    a given input will be targeted with its derived selector (like `input[name=email]`).

    For this to work hungry elements [must have a derivable target selector](/up-hungry#derivable-target-required).

  /*-
  Before an `[up-hungry]` is added to a render pass, a event `up:fragment:hungry` is emitted on the element.

  ### Preventing hungry elements from being updated

  You may prevent the `up:fragment:hungry` event to exclude an hungry element from the render pass.
  Use this to define arbitrary conditions for when an hungry element should be updated.

  For example, the following would update an hungry element only for render passes that [update history](/updating-history):

  ```js
  element.addEventListener('up:fragment:hungry', function(event) {
    if (!event.renderOptions.history) event.preventDefault()
  })
  ```

  You may also define conditions based on the *new* element that a hungry element would be swapped with.
  The following would skip an update if the new element has a class `.is-empty`:

  ```js
  element.addEventListener('up:fragment:hungry', function(event) {
    if (event.newFragment.classList.contains('is-empty')) {
      event.preventDefault()
    }
  })
  ```

  @event up:fragment:hungry
  @param {Element} event.target
    The hungry element that is about to be swapped.
  @param {Element} event.newFragment
    The fragment in the new content that this hungry element would be swapped with.
  @param {Object} event.renderOptions
    The [render options](/up.render#parameters) for the current render pass.
  @param event.preventDefault()
    Prevents the hungry element from being targeted in the current render pass.
  @experimental
  */

  /*-
  Elements with an `[up-hungry]` attribute are updated whenever the server
  sends a matching element, even if the element isn't [targeted](/targeting-fragments).

  Hungry elements are optional in the same way as `:maybe` targets.
  When an `[up-hungry]` element does not match in the server response, the element will not be updated,
  but no error is thrown.

  ### Use cases

  Common use cases for `[up-hungry]` are elements that live in the application layout,
  outside of the fragment that is typically being targeted. Examples include:

  - Unread message counters
  - Page-specific subnavigation
  - Account-wide notifications (e.g. about an expired credit card)

  Instead of explicitly including such elements in every [target selector](/targeting-fragments)
  (e.g. `.content, .unread-messages:maybe`) we can mark the element as `[up-hungry]`:

  ```html
  <div class="unread-messages" up-hungry>
    You have no unread messages
  </div>
  ```

  An selector for the hungry element (`.unread-messages`) will be added to target selectors automatically.

  ### Derivable target required {#derivable-target-required}

  When an `[up-hungry]` fragment piggy-backs on another fragment update, Unpoly
  will [derive a target selector](/target-derivation) for the hungry element.

  For this to work the hungry element must have an [identifying attribute](/target-derivation#derivation-patterns),
  like an `[id]` or a unique `[class]` attribute.
  When no good target can be derived, the hungry element is excluded from the update.

  ### Behavior with multiple layers

  By default only hungry elements on the targeted [layer](/up.layer) are updated.

  To match a hungry element when updating other layers, set an [`[up-if-layer]`](#up-if-layer) attribute.
  For example, a hungry element with `[up-if-layer="subtree"]` will piggy-back on render passes for both
  its own layer and any overlay covering it.

  ### Conflict resolution

  When Unpoly renders new content, each element in that content can only be inserted once.
  When multiple hungry elements conflict with each other or with the the [primary render target](/targeting-fragments),
  that conflict is resolved using the following rules:

  1. When both a [target selector](/targeting-fragments) and a hungry elements target the same fragment in the response, only the direct render target will be updated.
  2. When hungry elements are nested within each other, the outmost fragment will be updated. Note that we recommend to not over-use the hungry mechanism, and prefer to explicit render targets instead.
  3. When hungry elements on different layers target the same fragment in the response,
     the layer closest to the rendering layer will be chosen.

  ### Disabling

  By default hungry fragments are processed for all updates of the current layer.
  You can disable the processing of hungry fragments using one of the following methods:

  - Rendering with an [`{ hungry: false }`](/up.render#options.hungry) option will not process any hungry fragments.
  - Setting an [`[up-use-hungry="false"]`](/up-follow#up-use-hungry) attribute on a link or form will not update hungry fragments when the element is activated.
  - Preventing an `up:fragment:hungry` event will prevent the hungry fragment
    from being updated.
  - Calling `event.preventDefault()` in an `[up-on-hungry]` attribute handler will prevent the hungry fragment
    from being updated.

  @selector [up-hungry]
  @param [up-if-layer='current']
    Only piggy-back on updates on [layers](/up.layer) that match the given [layer reference](/layer-option).

    Relative references like `'parent'` or `'child'` will be resolved in relation to the hungry element's layer.

    To match a hungry element when updating one of multiple layers, separate the references using and `or` delimiter.
    For example, `'current or child'` will match for updates on either the hungry element's layer, or
    its direct child.

    To match a hungry element when updating *any* layer, set this attribute to `'any'`.
  @param [up-on-hungry]
    Code to run before this element is included in a fragment update.

    Calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the hungry fragment
    from being updated.

    For instance, you want to auto-update an hungry navigation bar,
    but only if we're changing history entries:

    ```html
    <nav id="side-nav" up-hungry up-on-hungry="if (!renderOptions.history) event.preventDefault()">
     ...
    </nav>
    ```

    The code may use the variables `event` (of type `up:fragment:hungry`),
    `this` (the hungry element), `newFragment` and `renderOptions`.

  @param [up-transition]
    The [animated transition](/up-transition) to apply when this element is updated.
  @param [up-duration]
    The duration of the transition or animation (in millisconds).

  @param [up-easing]
    The timing function that accelerates the transition or animation.

    See [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function)
    for a list of available timing functions.

  Starts [polling](/up-poll) the given element.

  The given element does not need an `[up-poll]` attribute.

  @function up.radio.startPolling
  @param {Element} fragment
    The fragment to reload periodically.
  @param {Object} [options]
    Options for reloading the fragment.

    By default Unpoly will parse options from the fragment's attributes like ([`[up-interval]`](/up-poll#up-interval)).
    You may pass this additional options object to [supplement or override](/attributes-and-options#options) options parsed from the fragment's attributes.
  @param {number} [options.interval]
    The reload interval in milliseconds.

    Defaults to `up.radio.config.pollInterval`.
  @param {string} [options.url]
    The URL from which to reload the fragment.

    Defaults to the URL this fragment was [originally loaded from](/up-source).
  @param {string} [options.method='get']

  /*-
  Elements with an `[up-poll]` attribute are [reloaded](/up.reload) from the server periodically.

  ### Example

  Assume an application layout with an unread message counter.
  You can use `[up-poll]` to refresh the counter every 30 seconds:

  ```html
  <div class="unread-count" up-poll>
    2 new messages
  </div>
  ```

  ### Controlling the reload interval

  You may set an optional `[up-interval]` attribute to set the reload interval in milliseconds:

  ```html
  <div class="unread-count" up-poll up-interval="10000">
    2 new messages
  </div>
  ```

  If the value is omitted, a global default is used. You may configure the default like this:

  ```js
  up.radio.config.pollInterval = 10000
  ```

  ### Controlling the source URL

  The element will be reloaded from the URL from which it was originally loaded.

  To reload from another URL, set an `[up-source]` attribute on the polling element:

  ```html
  <div class="unread-count" up-poll up-source="/unread-count">
    2 new messages
  </div>
  ```

  ### Controlling the target selector

  A target selector will be [derived](/target-derivation) from the polling element.

  ### Polling is paused in the background

  By default polling will pause while the fragment's [layer](/up.layer) is covered by an overlay.
  When the layer is uncovered, polling will resume.
  To keep polling on background layers, set [`[up-if-layer=any]`](#up-if-layer).

  Polling will also pause automatically while the browser tab is hidden.
  When the browser tab is re-activated, polling will resume.

  When at least one poll interval was spent paused in the background and the user
  then returns to the layer or tab, Unpoly will immediately reload the fragment.
  You can use this to load recent data when the user returns to your app after working on something else for a while. For example, the following
  would reload your [main](/main) element after an absence of 5 minutes or more:

  ```html
  <main up-poll up-interval="300_000">
    ...
  </main>
   ```

  ### Skipping updates on the client

  Client-side code may skip an update by preventing an `up:fragment:poll` event
  on the polling fragment.


  ### Skipping updates on the server

  When polling a fragment periodically we want to avoid rendering unchanged content.
  This saves <b>CPU time</b> and reduces the <b>bandwidth cost</b> for a
  request/response exchange to about 1 KB (1 packet).

  See [Skipping rendering](/skipping-rendering) for more details and examples.

  When an update is skipped, Unpoly will try to poll again after the configured interval.

  ### Stopping polling

  There are multiple ways to stop the polling interval:

  - The fragment from the server response no longer has an `[up-poll]` attribute.
  - The fragment from the server response has an `[up-poll="false"]` attribute.
  - Client-side code has called `up.radio.stopPolling()` with the polling element.
