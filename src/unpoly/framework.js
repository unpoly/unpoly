  Manually boots the Unpoly framework.

  It is not usually necessary to call `up.boot()` yourself. When you load [Unpoly's JavaScript file](/install),
  Unpoly will automatically boot on [`DOMContentLoaded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event).
  There are only two cases when you would boot manually:

  - When you load Unpoly with `<script async>`
  - When you explicitly ask to manually boot by loading Unpoly with [`<script up-boot="manual">`](/up-boot-manual).

  Before you manually boot, Unpoly should be configured and compilers should be registered.
  Booting will cause Unpoly to [compile](/up.hello) the initial page.

  Unpoly will refuse to boot if the current browser is [not supported](/up.framework.isSupported).
  This leaves you with a classic server-side application on legacy browsers.

  Returns whether Unpoly can boot in the current browser.

  If this returns `false` Unpoly will not automatically [boot](/up.boot)
  and will not [compile](/up.compiler) the initial page.
  This leaves you with a server-side web application without any JavaScript enhancements.

  The support check is very cursory. While it will exclude most legacy browsers
  like Internet Explorer, there may be cases where `up.framework.isSupported()`
  returns `true` on a browser with other support issues.
  To use your own conditions for browser support, [boot manually](/up-boot-manual).

  ### Browser support

  Unpoly aims to supports all modern browsers.

  #### Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge

  Unpoly supports recent versions of these [evergreen](https://stephenweiss.dev/evergreen-browsers) browsers.

  #### Safari, Mobile Safari

  Unpolys upports the last two major versions of Safari.

  #### Internet Explorer

  Internet Explorer 11 or lower are [now longer supported](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/discussions/340).

  If you need to support Internet Explorer 11, use Unpoly 2.
