/*-
Server protocol
===============

Unpoly has an **optional** protocol your server may implement to exchange additional information
when Unpoly is [updating fragments](/up.link). The protocol mostly works by adding
additional HTTP headers (like `X-Up-Target`) to requests and responses.

> [IMPORTANT]
> While the protocol can help you optimize performance and handle some edge cases,
> implementing it is **entirely optional**. For instance, `unpoly.com` itself is a static site
> that uses Unpoly on the frontend and doesn't even have an active server component.

## Existing implementations

You should be able to implement the protocol in a very short time.

There are existing implementations for various web frameworks:

- [Ruby on Rails](/install/ruby)
- [Roda](https://github.com/adam12/roda-unpoly)
- [Rack](https://github.com/adam12/rack-unpoly) (Sinatra, Padrino, Hanami, Cuba, ...)
- [Phoenix](https://elixirforum.com/t/unpoly-a-framework-like-turbolinks/3614/15) (Elixir)
- [PHP](https://github.com/webstronauts/php-unpoly) (Symfony, Laravel, Stack)
- [Python](https://gitlab.com/rocketduck/python-unpoly) (Python, including Django support)

  const e = up.element

  const headerize = function(camel) {

    return 'X-Up' + header
  }

  This request header contains the current Unpoly version to mark this request as a fragment update.

  Server-side code may check for the presence of an `X-Up-Version` header to
  distinguish [fragment updates](/up.link) from full page loads.

  The `X-Up-Version` header is guaranteed to be set for all [requests made through Unpoly](/up.request).

  ### Example

  The user updates a fragment. Unpoly automatically includes the following request header:

    ```http
  X-Up-Version: 1.0.0
  ```

  The server chooses to render different HTML to Unpoly requests, e.g. by excluding the document `<head>`
  and only rendering the `<body>`. The server responds with the folowing HTTP:

  ```http
  Vary: X-Up-Version

  <body>
    ...
  </body>
  ```

  @include vary-header-note

  @header X-Up-Version
  @stable
  */

  /*-
  This request header contains the [target selector](/targeting-fragments) for a successful fragment update.

  Server-side code is free to [optimize its response](/optimizing-responses) by only rendering HTML
  that matches the selector. For example, you might prefer to not render an
  expensive sidebar if the sidebar is not targeted.

  Unpoly will usually update a different selector in case the request fails.
  This selector is sent as a second header, `X-Up-Fail-Target`.

  ### Example

  The user updates a fragment `.menu`.
  Unpoly automatically includes the following request header:

  ```http
  X-Up-Target: .menu
  ```

  The server chooses to render only the HTML for the updating fragment.
  It responds with the following HTTP:

  ```http
  Vary: X-Up-Target

  <div class="menu">...</div>
  ```

  @include vary-header-note

  ### Changing the render target from the server

  The server may change the render target context by including a CSS selector as an `X-Up-Target` header
  in its response.

  ```http
  Content-Type: text/html
  X-Up-Target: .selector-from-server

  <div class="selector-from-server">
    ...
  </div>
  ```

  The frontend will use the server-provided target for both successful (HTTP status `200 OK`)
  and failed (status `4xx` or `5xx`) responses.


  ### Rendering nothing

  The server may send an `X-Up-Target: :none` response header with an empty body to skip the current render pass.

  Also see [skipping unnecessary rendering](/skipping-rendering).


  ### Optional targets

  An optional selector part (`:maybe` suffix) will be omitted from an `X-Up-Target` header unless it
  matches in the current page.

  Required selector parts are always included in `X-Up-Target`.


  ### Merging of request targets

  When two [caching](/caching) requests are sent to the same URL within the same [microtask](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide),
  only a single request is sent. The request will contain both targets in its `X-Up-Target` header.

  For example, these two render passes render different selectors from `/path`:

  ```js
  up.render('.foo', { url: '/path', cache: true })
  up.render('.bar', { url: '/path', cache: true })
  ```

  Unpoly will send a single request with both targets:

  ```http
  GET /path HTTP/1.1
  X-Up-Target: .foo, .bar
  ```

  @header X-Up-Target
  @stable
  */

  /*-
  This request header contains the [target selector](/targeting-fragments) for a failed fragment update.

  A fragment update is considered *failed* if the server responds with a status code other than 2xx,
  but still renders HTML.

  Server-side code is free to [optimize its response](/optimizing-responses) to a failed request by only rendering HTML
  that matches the provided selector. For example, you might prefer to not render an
  expensive sidebar if the sidebar is not targeted.

  ### Example

  ```http
  X-Up-Target: .menu
  X-Up-Fail-Target: body
  ```

  ### Signaling failed form submissions

  When [submitting a form via AJAX](/form-up-submit)
  Unpoly needs to know whether the form submission has failed (to update the form with
  validation errors) or succeeded (to update the `[up-target]` selector).

  For Unpoly to be able to detect a failed form submission, the response must be
  return a non-2xx HTTP status code. We recommend to use
  [HTTP 422](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/422) (Unprocessable Entity).

  To do so in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), pass a [`:status` option to `render`](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#the-status-option):

  ```ruby
  class UsersController < ApplicationController

    def create
      user_params = params[:user].permit(:email, :password)
      @user = User.new(user_params)
      if @user.save?
        sign_in @user
      else
        render 'form', status: :unprocessable_entity
      end
    end

  Unpoly automatically includes the following request headers:

  ```http

  ETags can be used to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged content.
  See [Conditional requests](/conditional-requests) for details and examples.

  ### Format

  A (weak) ETag typically looks like this:

  ### Overriding the client-side default

  If the server does not send an `X-Up-Expire-Cache` header, Unpoly will [expire the entire cache](/up.network.config#config.expireCache) after a non-GET request.

  X-Up-Expire-Cache: false

  function contextFromXHR(xhr) {
    return extractHeader(xhr, 'context', JSON.parse)
  }

  /*-
  This request header contains the targeted layer's [context](/context), serialized as JSON.

  ### Example

  The current layer has a context `{ lives: 3 }`.
  When the user updates a fragment, Unpoly automatically includes the following request headers:

  ```http
  X-Up-Context: { "lives": 3 }
  X-Up-Target: main
  ```

  The server may choose to render HTML based on that context, e.g. by including
  a live counter in the response. It responds with the following HTTP:

  ```http
  Vary: X-Up-Context

  <main>
    3 lives left
    ...
  </main>
  ```

  @include vary-header-note

  ### Updating context from the server

  The server may update the layer context by sending a `X-Up-Context` response header with
  changed key/value pairs:

  ```http
  Content-Type: text/html
  X-Up-Context: { "lives": 2 }

  <html>
    ...
  </html>
  ```

  @include unicode-header-values

  Upon seeing the response header, Unpoly will merge the server-provided context object into
  the layer's context object, adding or replacing keys as needed.
  Client-side context keys not mentioned in the response will remain unchanged.

  There is no explicit protocol to *remove* keys from the context, but the server may send a key
  with a `null` value to effectively remove a key.

  The frontend will use the server-provided context upates for both successful (HTTP status `200 OK`)
  and failed (status `4xx` or `5xx`) responses.  If no `X-Up-Context` response header is set,
  the updating layer's context will not be changed.

  It is recommended that the server only places changed key/value pairs into the `X-Up-Context`
  response header, and not echo the entire context object. Otherwise any client-side changes made while
  the request was in flight will get overridden by the server-provided context.

  For example, you might prefer to not render a site navigation for overlays.

  ### Example

  ```http
  X-Up-Fail-Context: { "context": "Choose a company contact" }
  ```

  @function up.protocol.methodFromXHR

  */
  function methodFromXHR(xhr) {
    return extractHeader(xhr, 'method', u.normalizeMethod)
  }

  /*-
  The server may set this optional response header to change the HTTP method after a fragment update.

  Without this header Unpoly will use the [requested method](/up.Request.prototype.method).

  ### Signaling the HTTP method after a redirect

  Without an `X-Up-Method` header, Unpoly will assume a `GET` method after a redirect.

  This assumption is correct for redirects with status codes 301, 302 and 303,
  and incorrect for the [less common codes 307 and 308](https://makandracards.com/makandra/501468-modern-http-status-codes-for-redirecting).

  Also for technical reason Unpoly cannot detect redirects to the same URL, but using a different method. For example, when a request
  to `POST /users` redirects to `GET /users`.

  You can address both edge cases by including an `X-Up-Method` header in your responses.

  ### Example

  ```http
  X-Up-Location: /users
  X-Up-Method: GET
  ```

  @header X-Up-Method
  @stable

  /*-
  @function up.protocol.titleFromXHR

  /*-
  The server may set this optional response header to change the document title after a fragment update.

  Without this header Unpoly will extract the `<title>` from the server response.

  This header is useful when you [optimize your response](/optimizing-responses) to not render
  the application layout unless targeted. When your shortened response
  no longer includes a `<title>`, you can instead use this HTTP header to pass the document title.

  @include unicode-header-values

  ### Example

  ```http
  X-Up-Title: "Playlist browser"
  ```

  Note that the quotes must be included in the JSON-encoded header value.

  @header X-Up-Title
  @stable
  */

  /*-
  This request header contains the names of the [form fields being validated](/up-validate).

  When seeing this header, the server is [expected](/up-validate#backend-protocol)
  to validate (but not save) the form submission and render a new form state with validation errors.
  See the documentation for `[up-validate]` for more information
  on how server-side validation works in Unpoly.

  ### Example

  Let's look at a registration form that uses `[up-validate]` to validate form groups
  as the user completes fields:

  ```html
  <form action="/users">

    <fieldset>
      <label for="email" up-validate>E-mail</label> <!-- mark-phrase "up-validate" -->
      <input type="text" id="email" name="email">
    </fieldset>

    <fieldset>
      <label for="password" up-validate>Password</label> <!-- mark-phrase "up-validate" -->
      <input type="password" id="password" name="password">
    </fieldset>

    <button type="submit">Register</button>

  </form>
  ```

  When the `email` input is changed, Unpoly will submit the form with an
  additional `X-Up-Validate` header:

  ```http
  X-Up-Validate: email
  X-Up-Target: fieldset:has(#email)
  ```

  ### Batched validations

  If multiple validations are [batched](/up.validate#batching) into a single request,
  `X-Up-Validate` contains a space-separated list of all validating field names:

  ```http
  X-Up-Validate: email password
  X-Up-Target: fieldset:has(#password)
  ```

  ### When no origin field is known

  When `up.validate()` is called with a non-field element, Unpoly might not know
  which element triggered the validation. In that case the header value will be `:unknown`:

  ```http
  X-Up-Validate: :unknown
  X-Up-Target: .preview
  ```

  ### When too many fields are validated

  Validating a long form may cause the `X-Up-Validate` header to become excessively long.
  This may cause web infrastructure from rejecting the request with an `413 Entity Too Large` error.

  To prevent this, the header value is set to `:unknown` if its length exceeds `up.protocol.config.maxHeaderSize`.

  The header value is a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) array.
  Each element in the array is a JSON object representing an event to be emitted
  on the `document`.

  The object property `{ "type" }` defines the event's [type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/type). Other properties become properties of the emitted

  ### Emitting an event on a layer

  Instead of emitting an event on the `document`, the server may also choose to

  `{ "layer": "current" }` to the JSON object of an event:

  If the initial page was loaded with a non-`GET` HTTP method, Unpoly prefers to make a full
  page load when you try to update a fragment. Once the next page was loaded with a `GET` method,
  Unpoly will again update fragments.

  This fixes two edge cases you might or might not care about:

  1. Unpoly replaces the initial page state so it can later restore it when the user
     goes back to that initial URL. However, if the initial request was a POST,
     Unpoly will wrongly assume that it can restore the state by reloading with GET.
  2. Some browsers have a bug where the initial request method is used for all
     subsequently pushed states. That means if the user reloads the page on a later
     GET state, the browser will wrongly attempt a POST request.
     This issue affects Safari 9-12 (last tested in 2019-03).
     Modern Firefoxes, Chromes and IE10+ don't have this behavior.

  In order to allow Unpoly to detect the HTTP method of the initial page load,
  the server must set a cookie:

  ```http
  Set-Cookie: _up_method=POST
  ```

  When Unpoly boots it will look for this cookie and configure itself accordingly.
  The cookie is then deleted in order to not affect following requests.

  The **simplest implementation** is to set this cookie for every request that is neither
  `GET` nor an [Unpoly request](/X-Up-Version). For all other requests
  an existing `_up_method` cookie should be deleted.

  You only need to set `X-Up-Location` when you want to explicitly set a different URL.

  When setting `X-Up-Location` it is recommended to also set `X-Up-Method`.

  ### Example

  ```http
  X-Up-Location: /current-url
  X-Up-Method: GET
  ```

  @header X-Up-Location
  @stable

  // TODO: Move to up.Response#varyHeaderNames
  function influencingHeaderNamesFromResponse(response) {
    let varyHeaderValue = response.header('Vary')
    return u.parseTokens(varyHeaderValue, { separator: 'comma' })
  }

  /*-
  Request headers that influenced a response should be listed in a `Vary` response header.

  This tells Unpoly to [partition its cache](/caching#caching-optimized-responses) for that URL so that each
  request header value gets a separate cache entries.

  You can set a `Vary` header manually from your server-side code. You may also be using
  a library like [unpoly-rails](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly-rails) that sets the `Vary` header automatically.


  > [tip]
  > Server-side Unpoly apps may inspect [request headers](/up.protocol) to [customize or shorten responses](/optimizing-responses),
  > e.g. by omitting content that isn't [targeted](/targeting-fragments).
  > When a response is optimized in that fasion, a `Vary` header should be sent.

  ### Example

  @include vary-header-example

  See [How cache entries are matched](/caching#how-cache-entries-are-matched) for more examples.

  /*-
  Configures strings used in the optional [server protocol](/up.protocol).

  @property up.protocol.config

  @param {string} [config.csrfHeader='X-CSRF-Token']
    The name of the HTTP header that will include the
    [CSRF token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Synchronizer_token_pattern)
    for AJAX requests.

  @param {string|Function(): string} [config.csrfParam]
    The `name` of the hidden `<input>` used for sending a
    [CSRF token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Synchronizer_token_pattern) when
    submitting a default, non-AJAX form. For AJAX request the token is sent as an
    [HTTP header](/up.protocol.config#config.csrfHeader instead.

    The parameter name can be configured as a string or as function that returns the parameter name.
    If no name is set, no token will be sent.

    Defaults to the `content` attribute of a `<meta>` tag named `csrf-param`:

    ```html
    <meta name="csrf-param" content="authenticity_token">
    ```

  @param {string|Function(): string} [config.csrfToken]
    The [CSRF token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Synchronizer_token_pattern)
    to send for unsafe requests. The token will be sent as either a HTTP header (for AJAX requests)
    or hidden form `<input>` (for default, non-AJAX form submissions).

    The token can either be configured as a string or as function that returns the token.
    If no token is set, no token will be sent.

    Defaults to the `content` attribute of a `<meta>` tag named `csrf-token`:

    ```
    <meta name='csrf-token' content='secret12345'>
    ```

  @param {string|Function(): string} [config.cspNonce]
    A [CSP script nonce](https://content-security-policy.com/nonce/)
    for the initial page that [booted](/up.boot) Unpoly.

    The nonce let Unpoly run JavaScript in HTML attributes like
    [`[up-on-loaded]`](/a-up-follow#up-on-loaded) or [`[up-on-accepted]`](/a-up-layer-new#up-on-accepted).
    See [Working with a strict Content Security Policy](/csp).

    The nonce can either be configured as a string or as function that returns the nonce.

    Defaults to the `content` attribute of a `<meta>` tag named `csp-nonce`:

    ```
    <meta name='csrf-token' content='secret98765'>
    ```

  @param {string} [config.methodParam='_method']
    The name of request parameter containing the original request method when Unpoly needs to
    [wrap](/up.network.config#config.wrapMethod) the method.

    Methods must be wrapped when making a [full page request](/up.network.loadPage) with a methods other
    than GET or POST. In this case Unpoly will make a POST request with the original request method
    in a form parameter named `_method`:

    ```http
    POST /test HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Content-Length: 11

    _method=PUT
    ```

  @param {number} [config.maxHeaderSize]
    The preferred maximum length of an `X-Up`-prefixed header's value.

    This is currently only honored for `X-Up-Validate`.
