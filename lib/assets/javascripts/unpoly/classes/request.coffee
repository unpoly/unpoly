u = up.util
e = up.element

###**
A normalized description of an [HTTP request](`up.request()`).

You can queue a request using the `up.request()` method:

```js
let request = up.request('/foo')
console.log(request.url)

// A request object is also a promise for its response
let response = await request
console.log(response.text)
```

@class up.Request
###
class up.Request extends up.Record

  ###**
  The HTTP method for the request.

  @property up.Request#method
  @param {string} method
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  The URL for the request.

  @property up.Request#url
  @param {string} url
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  The [hash component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment) of this request's URL.

  The `{ hash }` property is automatically extracted from the given URL:

  ```js
  let request = up.request({ url: '/path#section' })
  request.url // => '/path'
  request.hash // => '#section'
  ```

  @property up.Request#hash
  @param {string} hash
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  [Parameters](/up.Params) that should be sent as the request's payload.

  @property up.Request#params
  @param {Object|FormData|string|Array} params
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  The CSS selector targeted by this request.

  The selector will be sent as an `X-Up-Target` header.

  @property up.Request#target
  @param {string} target
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  The CSS selector targeted by this request in case the server responds
  with an [error code](/server-errors).

  The selector will be sent as an `X-Up-Fail-Target` header.

  @property up.Request#failTarget
  @param {string} failTarget
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  An object of additional HTTP headers.

  Unpoly will by default send a number of custom request headers.
  See `up.protocol` and `up.network.config.metaKeys` for details.

  @property up.Request#headers
  @param {Object} headers
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  A timeout in milliseconds.

  If `up.network.config.maxRequests` is set,
  the timeout will not include the time spent waiting in the queue.

  @property up.Request#timeout
  @param {Object|undefined} timeout
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  Whether to wrap non-standard HTTP methods in a POST request.

  If this is set, methods other than GET and POST will be converted to a `POST` request
  and carry their original method as a `_method` parameter. This is to [prevent unexpected redirect behavior](https://makandracards.com/makandra/38347).

  Defaults to [`up.network.config`](/up.network.config#config.wrapMethod).

  @property up.Request#wrapMethod
  @param {boolean} wrapMethod
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  The [context](/contact) of the layer targeted by this request.

  The context object will be sent as an `X-Up-Context` header.

  @property up.Request#context
  @param {Object} context
  @experimental
  ###

  ###**
  The [context](/contact) of the layer targeted by this request in case the server responds with an [error code](/server-errors).

  The context object will be sent as an `X-Up-Fail-Context` header.

  @property up.Request#failContext
  @param {Object} failContext
  @experimental
  ###

  ###**
  The [layer](/up.layer) targeted by this request.

  Setting the `{ layer }` property will automatically derive `{ context }` and `{ mode }` properties.

  To prevent memory leaks, this property is removed shortly after the response is received.

  @property up.Request#layer
  @param {up.Layer} layer
  @experimental
  ###

  ###**
  The [layer](/up.layer) targeted by this request in case the server responds with an [error code](/server-errors).

  Setting the `{ failLayer }` property will automatically derive `{ failContext }` and `{ failMode }` properties.

  To prevent memory leaks, this property is removed shortly after the response is received.

  @property up.Request#failLayer
  @param {up.Layer} layer
  @experimental
  ###

  ###**
  The element that triggered the request.

  For example, when this request was triggered by a click on a link, the link
  element is set as the `{ origin }`.

  To prevent memory leaks, this property is removed shortly after the response is received.

  @property up.Request#origin
  @param {Element} origin
  @experimental
  ###

  ###**
  The [mode](/up.Layer.prototype.mode) of the layer targeted by this request.

  The value will be sent as an `X-Up-Mode` header.

  @property up.Request#mode
  @param {string} mode
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  The [mode](/up.Layer.prototype.mode) of the layer targeted by this request in case the server responds with an [error code](/server-errors).

  The value will be sent as an `X-Up-Fail-Mode` header.

  @property up.Request#failMode
  @param {string} failMode
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  The format in which the [request params](/up.Layer.prototype.params) will be encoded.

  @property up.Request#contentType
  @param {string} contentType
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  The payload that the request will encode into its body.

  By default Unpoly will build a payload from the given `{ params }` option.

  @property up.Request#payload
  @param {string} payload
  @stable
  ###

  ###**
  @property up.Request#preload
  @param {boolean} preload
  @experimental

  ###**
  Loads this request object as a full-page request, replacing the entire browser environment
  with a new page from the server response.

  The full-page request will be loaded with the [URL](/up.Request.prototype.url),
  [method](/up.Request.prototype.method) and [params](/up.Request.prototype.params)
  from this request object.
  Properties that are not possible in a full-page request (such as custom HTTP headers)
  will be ignored.
