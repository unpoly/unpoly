Draft for Unpoly 4
==================

Focus
-----

- Focus on removal and simplification.
- Use browser-native functionality where possible.
- Focus on cleaning up mistakes.
- Don't do [up-frame] in V4. Users deserve a break from disrupting API changes.


Strong candidates
-----------------

- Replace target merging in up.FormValidator with a generic request merging facility that merges headers
- Consider removing all up.migrate polyfills (and library hooks!) except changes from v3 => v4
  - Users would need to upgrade to v3 before upgrading to v4
  - Users could no longer stay on unpoly-migrate forever without updating their code
  => Check impact before we do this
- Deprecate [up-id] in favor of just [id]
  - This is required if we ever want to use something like idiomorph, which relies on [id] heavily
- Replace up.URLPattern with standard URLPattern
  - Not yet supported by Firefox and Safari: https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_urlpattern
  - Polyfillable: https://github.com/kenchris/urlpattern-polyfill
  - Existing $syntax for matching digits would need to be replaced with regexes
  - A migrate warning would be possible
- Remove up.rails package
  - This was only needed for co-existence with rails-ujs. Modern Rails apps no longer include this.
  - We could also offer this as an optional file (unpoly-rails-ujs.js)
  - Unpoly core already parses [data-confirm] and [data-method]. No additional support is needed just to use { method } and { confirm } options.
- Internals: Consider replacing up.Record with custom constructors
- Consider removing up.copy.key && up.isEqual.key
  - poll users
  - currently used by up.Params
- Consider an { onUpdate } callback so users can setup view transitions or implement morphins
  - See view-transitions.md  
- Consider removing layer context
  - I think users find it sufficient to look at X-Up-Mode instead
  - [poll users]
- Popups
  - Consider extraction into its own plugin
  - Replace up.Tether with CSS anchor positioning / [anchor-name]
    - https://blog.logrocket.com/use-css-anchor-positioning/
    - Not even on caniuse yet: https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/issues/6471
  - Consider requiring an external library for tethering (e.g. "Floating UI")
- Remove :has() polyfill
  - Firefox ESR should get :has() support in Q4/2024
    - https://whattrainisitnow.com/calendar/
  - We can also do this later as it's not a breaking change
  - Also many docs mention this as a key difference between up.element and up.fragment
- Once we use native :has(), can we get replace up.Selector with CSS selector expansion?
  - Excluding .up-destroying would just be :is(original-selector):not(.up-destroying, .up-destroying *)
  - Matching layers would require a longer selector
    - :is(original-selector):is([up-layer-index=3], [up-layer-index=3] * [up-layer-index=4])
- Consider making secondary targets optional by default
- Remove event mapping
  - Remove up.form.config.watchInputEvents
  - Remove up.form.config.watchChangeEvents
    - Why do we still have a test for date inputs being watched on blur instead of change?
  - Remove doc section "Normalizing non-standard events"
- Implement up.motion with the web animations API
  - We can also remove up.CSSTransition
- [Summer 2024] Replace up.util.reverse() with Array#toReversed()
  - https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_array_toreversed
    - Safari has this since September 2022
    - Firefox ESR already has this
- Async compiler functions
  - Many edge cases
  - See separate doc
- Remove up.reveal()
  - Users could set scroll-margin in their CSS instead
  - This also lets us remove up.RevealMotion, up.Rect, [up-fixed]
  - We still need [up-anchored=right]
- Replace .up-focus-visible and .up-focus-hidden classes with Element#focus({ focusVisible })
- Check browser support for Element#focus({ focusVisible }) option
  - This could let us remove .up-focus-visible and .up-focus-hidden
  - https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_htmlelement_focus_options_focusvisible_parameter
  - What { focusVisible } cannot do is stickiness: Switch to other window, switch back
    - Maybe that's OK
- Remove selector/element/jQuery argument normalization
  - Consider requiring elements for functions that work with elements, not selectors or jQuery collections
  - Consider removing all remaining jQuery support
    - The same polyfill that checks for selector removal could print a warning for jQuery
- [up-instant] and [up-preload] should listen on pointerdown instead of mousedown
- Document throws
  - But consider waiting until async compilers, as we're changing some method signatures
  - How do we document async rejections?
    - up.link.preload() documents in @return
- Consider removing X-Up-Title, [up-title] and { title } since we now auto-update head elements


Low confidence / Much design work needed
----------------------------------------

- Check if we can replace up.Params with FormData and a few helper methods
  - We already tried this a few years ago and gave up. Maybe FormData API is nicer now.
  - There's also URLSearchParams as a new type...
- up.animate() and up.morph() could return an Animation object
  - For what?
  - If people manually call Animate#finish() etc. this may make it harder to enforce our motion logic
- Reconsider objects that also serve as their own promises
  - up.Request, await up.request().loaded
  - up.RenderJob, await up.render().rendered
  - Instead the promise could be returned by a property like #loaded or #rendered
  - This would be more in sync with how the Animation API works
    - But otherwise it's worse econonomics
  - This *might* make it easier to compose with standard promises
    - Challange that with actual code
  - We could polyfill it
- Consider moving history-related methods from up.Layer.Base to up.history
  - All other packages work by taking a { layer } option, why not history-related?
  - This change would require a lot more design
- Automatic up.hello() with MutationObserver
  - This seems to make more problems than solutions whenever another DOM manipulating library is involved :(
  - Needs to be async?
    - Effects of insertion could not be observed until 1 task later
    - This would make up.destroy() async
  - Performance?
  - Possibly disable observing while we are rendering content ourselves
    - Compilers should still insert elements and see them auto-compiled
    - Maybe like this:
      ```
      disableObserver()
      insertElements()
      enableObserver()
      compileElements
      ```
  - Edge cases
    - Macros can insert elements with other macros
      - Do we want this?
      - Do we still need macros with auto-compilation?
    - Compilers can insert elements and see them auto-compiled
    - React
      - Compilers that change the DOM should not cause React to permanently re-render a subtree (the VDOM didn't change, but the DOM did)
      - Compilers that change the DOM should not cause React to undo these DOM changes
      - We should not cause hydration errors when pre-rendering on the server
        - The compiler might only run on the client
      - https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/integrating-with-other-libraries.html
      - https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/external-dom-mutations/
    - Maybe we need a way to disable Unpoly for a subtree ([up-ignore])
- Consider removing transitions/morphing with ViewTransitions (single-document)
  - See view-transitions.md
