TODOs for next release
======================


Various changes
---------------

- Fix all Webpack errors
  - Start out with a fresh build
- Merge up.migrate.handleScrollOptions into up.migrate.preprocessRenderOptions
- Remove RenderOptions.addCallback
- Rethink request defaults
  - Rethink whether we want to link up.request() to the current layer by default?
    - Or only when { layer } or { origin } options are given?
    - We could argue that this is a low-level API and up.render() should be used for updating content
    - Counter-point is: All other functionality sees the current layer by default
    - If we do this we should also remove auto-lookup of { targetElements }
  - When instantiating an up.Request with neither { target } or { targetElements }, do we want to default to @layer.element ?
- makeLayers([{ content }]) leaves <up-wrapper> elements in the DOM
- up.layer.config.foreignOverlaySelectors
  - When focusing within such a selector our overlay focus trap would not steal focus
  - When clicking within such a selector we would not do an outside-dismiss
  - Configure for unpoly-bootstrap
    - .dropdown-menu
    - .modal
    - .popover
- Allow to mark a target component as soft:
  - .target, .other:maybe
  - .target, :maybe(.other)
- Maybe log close value with up:layer:dismiss/:dismissed/:accept/:accepted
- Make sure that up:layer:dismiss/:dismissed/:accept/:accepted expose { value }
  - Presence form does not in the docs
- Make sure that up:layer:dismiss/:dismissed/:accept/:accepted expose { origin }
  - At least key dimissalm outside does not

### unpoly-rails

- unpoly-rails must have up.validate_names instead of up.validate_name
- unpoly-rails should discard invalid JSON: https://zammad.makandra.de/#ticket/zoom/76579


Docs
----

### Watch/validate rework

- Consider consolidating docs for
  - input[up-watch]/form[up-watch] as well as
  - input[up-validate]/form[up-validate]
  - input[up-autosubmit]/form[up-autosubmit]
  - ... so it's only "within the container"
- [up-watch-feedback], [up-watch-disable],  [up-watch-delay],  [up-watch-event]
  - [up-autosubmit] needs a params note saying that that attributes for [up-watch] may be used
  - [up-validate] needs a params note saying that that attributes for [up-watch] may be used
  - Explain that they can be set either on the form or on an input
- New obserrve options are not documented everywhere
  - form[up-autosubmit]
  - input[up-autsubmit]
  - input[up-watch]
  - form[up-watch]
- Docs for up.validate()
  - { feedback, disable, delay, event }
  - Explain that you can use it both on containers and individual fields
- New watch() and validate() options
  - { feedback, disable, delay, event }
- Document all the ways we prevent concurrency
  - In up.watch()
  - In up.validate()
  - Document that multiple [up-validate] requests are merged into a single request

### Other docs

- up.layer.config.foreignOverlaySelectors
- Explain that preloading will not abort other requests
- Explain and test [up-validate] usage for radio buttons
- Document { abort } option and [up-abort] everywhere
- Überall wo [up-target] oder { target } dokumentiert ist nach https://unpoly.com/fragment-placement verlinken
- Test and Document that we can use live validation like this:
  <input up-keep up-validate up-watch-event="input">
- Document that X-Up-Validate may contain multiple names
- Document that X-Up-Validate may contain :unknown
- Document django-forms-dynamic for [up-validate]
  - https://twitter.com/j4mie/status/1471610935924215815?t=KtCISFJXz3kEMoc6C3y4UQ&s=09
  - https://github.com/dabapps/django-forms-dynamic
- Consider a new page for caching and verification
- up.form.config.inputEvents
- up.form.config.changeEvents
- up.form.config.inputDelay
- Missing docs for render options
  - { revealTop }
  - { revealMax }
  - { revealPadding }
  - { revealSnap }
  - { scrollBehavior }
    - if we stop auto-set it to auto, otherwise stop parsing this



Icebox
======

- Do follow links with [target=_self]
- up:click forking could print a warning when an a[href] is instant, but not followable
- Is it weird that up.layer.affix appends to the first swappable element instead of the contentElement?
  - It's actually more like "appendableElement"
  - Maybe offer up.Layer#append
- Consider exposing up.layer.contentElement
- Do we want a shortcut macro for this:
      <input up-validate up-keep up-watch-event="input">
  - <input up-live-validate>
  - It's weird for users who don't target the input. They may expect to just override the event.
- We could support this with more pseudo-class selectors like :form-group and :submit-button
  - :submit-button is hard to build origin-aware => It could just be a substitution with :is() / :-moz-any() & :-webkit-any()
  - :form-group is also supper hard to support in a selector like ".foo, :form-group, :bar" due to the way we hacked :has()
    - :has() is still behind a flag in Chrome and no Firefox support
- Introduce boundaries or "softly isolated zones"
  - The idea started with: Should fragment lookups with an { origin } within a form prefer to look within the form?
    - Also related to https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/issues/197 , which would no longer work
      now that a form submission's orgin is the submit button instead of the form element
  - E.g. <div up-boundary>
    - Lookups within prefer to match within the boundary
    - It's a new fallback target
      - Also for errors
    - up.fragment.config.boundaryTargets = ['[up-boundary]', 'form', ':main']
    - Is this also controlled by { fallback }?
    - Maybe identification using [up-boundary=123]
      - But don't enforce this, it's not a great auto-target
    - Should this rather be [up-zone]?
      - If we ever make fully isolated containers we would call them frames
        - https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/discussions/350
    - We could also offer :zone as a selector
    - Would we still offer { target: '.container .child' }?
      - Would we offer { target: ':zone .foo' }, since it's really the same as { target: '.foo' } ?
    - Is this a repetition of "fragment needs to know whether it is used as component or main target"?
      - We would need to fix infinite looping in expandTargets()
      - It would be nice to disable history in a zone
        - but then it's not usable as a main target
        - Disable history in a container?
          - It's weird to nest multiple containerish elements
        - => This is really already solved through { history: 'auto' }, which only updates history if updating :main
- Rendering: allow { scrollBehavior: 'smooth' } when we're not morphing
  - Could we even allow this *when* morphing?
- What is the purpose of up.error.emitGlobal?
  - Don't we throw a compound error that would be tracked?
    - We do
    - But the error does not bubble up
    - What do we want here?
- New up.render() options to clone from a template
  - { documentTemplate }, { fragmentTemplate }, { contentTemplate }
  - Separate doc page "Rendering from local content"
  - Fail when template cannot be found
  - But what if I really need to re-use an existing element that is then placed back into the body, like in WB?
- Consider implementing an abortable up:navigate event
  - This would be the first feature that goes beyond "navigation is just a preset"
  - People might expect history changes to trigger this
  - Maybe think about this more
- Allow to prevent Unpoly's state restoration handling with a preventable up:history:restore
  - We're currently forwarding an event up:history:restore to up:location:changed, but that was never public API
- Replace up.hello() and up.syntax.clean() to MutationObserver()
- Do we want to serialize all actions in a form?
  - up-sequence="form"
  - This would need to abortable on submit => Would be handled by existing { solo: 'target' } IF there is a request
  - This would need to abortable on form destroy => Would be handled by existing { solo: 'target' } IF there is a request
  - => This would need to be handled by up.Queue, or else there would be nothing to abort
  - => It is not sufficient to have up.form.sequence(..., callback)
  - => We would need to do something like { sequence: ElementOfSubtree }
  - => Before picking a new request, make sure no existing request exists
  - What about our old idea: { order: 'abort target', order: 'abort form', order: 'after form', order: 'after selector' }
      => How to say "after ElementObject" ?
  - Who would fetch the element that is 'form' or 'selector'?
      => up.Change.UpdateLayer#getPreflightProps(), which already loads targetElements()
  - What would we do if both was given, e.g. { solo: true, sequence: 'form' }
    - Do we forbid the combination?
    - Do we first abort, then do a squence?
    - Do we first wait, then abort? => I think this, but this also means our { solo } handling is in the wrong place. It must move to the queue.
  - Does { sequence: 'form' } also queue local content, like { solo } ?
   - We could do something like up.LocalRequest, but then local updates would no longer be sync!
   - We could not support { sequence } for local updates => YES
  - What about cached content with { sequence }?
    - We could do queue.asapLocal() which immediately executes unless there is { sequence }
  - How does queue resolve a sequence?
    - Before dispatching a request with { sequence }
    - Check if we have *current* requests with { sequence }
    - If any of the other requests's sequence contains our *or* if any other sequence is contained by ours, don't dispatch
- Guard Events for Rendering could have a Promise for "done"
  - Is this better than setting event.renderOptions.onFinished()?
    - Yes, because onFinished may not fire for fatals or prevented up:fragment:loaded
  - How would this work together with future up.RenderRequest?
  - How would this work together with "local changes are sync"?
- Consolidate [up-validate], [up-switch] and [up-watch] into a tree of form dependencies
  - This way we can selectively disable parts of the form
- Functionality that checks for isDetached() should probably also check for .up-destroying
- Improve `{ focus: 'keep' }` so it focuses the former form group if we lose focus
  - This may be easier said than done
    - we would need to remember the original form group before the swap in the FocusCapsule
    - re-discover the form group in the new HTML
    - check that the form group is a closer match than target-if-lost
    - come up for a better name for the option (target-if-lost)
- New event up:request:solo ?
- Consider delaying appending of new layer elements until we have constructed all children https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/discussions/314
- CheapEnergy hatte bedarf auf "[up-validate] on input"
- CheapEnergy hatte bedarf auf "[up-validate] mit delay"
- Publish { onQueued }
  - More canonic would be if up.render() returned a up.RenderRequest, which has abort().
- Wir aborten bereits laufende [up-validate] wenn das Formular submitted, wird, aber laufende Watcher-Delays warten können danach noch Dinge tun
  - Wie wäre "submit stoppt das delay"?
  Evtl. Warnung ausbauen: "Will not watch fields without [name]"
- [up-emit] auf Buttons erlauben
- Beim Schließen des Modals prevented jemand up:layer:dismiss, und dann steht "Abort Error: Close event was prevented" in der Konsole.
  - Wollen wir das schlucken?
  - Zumindest bei ui-elementen wie [up-dismiss] ?
- DestructorPass sammelt zwar Exceptions, aber wirft am Ende. Wer fängt das dann? Der Wunsch wäre, dass das drumrumliegende up.destroy() noch zu Ende läuft, dann aber up.CompilerError wirft.
- ConstructorPass sammelt zwar Exceptions, aber wirft am Ende. Wer fängt das dann? Der Wunsch wäre, dass das drumrumliegende up.render() oder up.hello() noch zu Ende läuft, dann aber mit up.CompilerError rejected.
- Update "Long Story" Slides with new API
- Doc page about "Fragments from local HTML"
  - link from [up-document], [up-fragment], [up-content], { document, fragment, content }.
- Warn when registering compiler in [up-] namespace
- Do we need window.history.scrollRestoration = 'manual' ?
  - Is this setting per-state?
