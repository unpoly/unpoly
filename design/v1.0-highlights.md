Motivation 1.0
==============

- Fix existing pain paints
- Capture existing patterns
- Make customization unncessariy

 It's the result of many observations of my colleagues at makandra, and the limits they ran into when using Unpoly for non-trivial interactions.




Default targets
===============

Most links don't need a target selector anymore
-----------------------------------------------

A lot of links simply replace the main content area. We often have a Rails helper like `content_link()` to set that default target.

Unpoly 1.0 lets you instead mark layer elements as default targets using the `[up-main]` attribute:

    <body>
      <div class="layout" up-main>
        <div class="layout--side">
          ...
        </div>
        <div class="layout--content">
          ...
        </div>
      </div>
    </body>

You no longer need [up-target] in a link. Use [up-follow] and the [up-main] will be replaced:

    <a href="/foo" up-follow>...</a>

If you want to replace something more specific, you can still use up-target as you're used to:

    <a href="/foo" up-target=".profile">...</a>

Instead of using `[up-main]` you may also configure main targets globally:

    up.fragment.config.targets.push('.layout--content')


Different main targets for overlays
-----------------------------------

You may also configure different mains for different layer modes:

E.g. to exclude a navigation for overlays:

    <body>
      <div class="layout" up-main="root">
        <div class="layout--side">
          ...
        </div>
        <div class="layout--content" up-main="overlay">
          ...
        </div>
      </div>
    </body>

Or to configure overlay targets manually:

    up.layer.config.popup.targets.push('.menu')              // for popup overlays
    up.layer.config.drawer.targets.push('.menu')             // for drawer overlays
    up.layer.config.overlay.targets.push('.layout--content') // for all overlays




Targets in components
=====================

The position of a clicked link may now considered when deciding which element to replace.

In this example we have two links that replace `.card`:

    <div class="card" id="card1">
      Card #1 preview
      <a href="/cards/1" up-target=".card">Show full card #1</a>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="card2">
      Card #2 preview
      <a href="/cards/2" up-target=".card">Show full card #2</a>
    </div>

When clicking "Sow full card #2", Unpoly 0.x would have replaced `.card`, matching the first card.

This makes it hard to use interactive components more than once in the same page.


Introducing :closest
--------------------

In Unpoly 1.0, links may refer to the closest ancestor with the `:closest` pseudo class:

    <div class="card" id="card1">
      Card #1 preview
      <a href="/cards/1" up-target=".card:closest">Show full card #1</a>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="card2">
      Card #2 preview
      <a href="/cards/2" up-target=".card:closest">Show full card #2</a>
    </div>

When clicking "Show full card #2", Unpoly 1.0 will replace `#card2` matching the second card.

While the card container still requires a unique selector (e.g. "id=card1"), none of the content elements do need to know about it.

This also works with descendant selectors:

    <div class="card" id="card1">
      <a href="/cards/1/links" up-target=".card:closest .card-links">Show card #2 links</a>
      <div class="card-links"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="card2">
      <a href="/cards/2/links" up-target=".card:closest .card-links">Show card #2 links</a>
      <div class="card-links"></div>
    </div>

When clicking "Show card#2 links", Unpoly 1.0 will replace `#card2 .card-links'.



Layers
=======

Unpoly had some form of layers (modals, popups) since its inception, but with many limitations:

- In Unpoly 0.x you may only stack two screens (three if you count popups).
  Unpoly 1.0 will let you stack an arbitrary number of screens.

- In Unpoly 0.x overlay content can accidentally change another layer by targeting an element that only exists in the parent.
  In Unpoly 1.0 layers are fully isolated from each other, so a fragment update cannot accidentally change another layer, except when you explicitely request so.

- In Unpoly 0.x overlay  content always needed to know which element in a parent layer to target.
  In Unpoly 1.0 screens will not need to know whether it is used in an overlay or as a full page. Parent layers will know when a sub-interactions are finished when the sub-interaction reaches a given URL, or when it emits a given event.

  This last point is very important to me, since I think server-side code should mostly be unaware of Unpoly.
  An Unpoly frontend should compose existing screens in novel ways, through fragment updates and now layering.
  A welcome side effect of this architecture is that the application will also work without JavaScript.


Terminology
-----------

The root page, modals and popups are consolidated into a single term "layer".

"Overlay" is any layer that is not the root layer.

There are different "modes" of overlays: `modal`, `popup`, `drawer` and `cover`.



Layers are now isolated
=======================

In Unpoly 0.x you could accidentally update another layer if there was no match in the current layer.

In Unpoly 1.x layers are fully isolated. You cannot accidentally target an element in another layer:

    <a up-target=".foo">                    <!-- will only match in current layer -->

If you want to do *anything* in another layer, you use `[up-layer]`:

    <a up-target=".foo" up-layer="parent">  <!-- will only match in parent layer -->
    <a up-target=".foo" up-layer="root">    <!-- will only match in root layer -->
    <a up-target=".foo" up-layer="new">     <!-- opens a new modal overlay -->

Remember:

- Some layer = Do nothing
- Any other layer = [up-layer]
- [up-modal] => use [up-layer="modal"]
- [up-popup] => use [up-layer="popup"]




Overlay results
===============

Overlays may have a result. E.g. if the user selects a value, we consider the overlay to be "accepted" with that value.

If the user closes the, we consider the overlay to be "dimissed".

They are like a promise:

    let user = await up.layer.ask({ url: '/select-user' })

Example: Flight Picker


Ways to end a sub-interaction
============================

- Accept location
- Emit an event (up-accept-on, up-emit)

Why this is great

- You have a CRUD interaction anyway
- Now embed it into another form
- The embedded interaction must not know when it is done!


More explicit ways
------------------

- Link with up-accept
- Server accepts
- up.accept()




Improved server integration
===========================

Examples for unpoly-rails (rack-unpoly etc. might follow.)

Server can close layers

    up.layer.accept(id: 5)
    up.layer.dismiss()

Server can emit events

    up.emit('user:selected', id: 5)
    up.layer.emit('user:selected', id: 5)

Values survive redirect

Server: Knows if a request targets an overlay

    up.layer.overlay?
    up.layer.root?





Layer context
=============

It's a virtual cookie for the current tab and layer!

Not actually a cookie

Layer-specific

Can be read and changed from the server

  up.context

  up.context['foo'] = 'bar'


Why this is useful
------------------

This is useful when you want to re-use an existing interaction, but make a slight variation.

    <a href='/contacts' up-layer='new' up-context='{ "forProject": 4 }'>Pick a contact for this project</a>

In /contacts/index.erb

    <% if up.context[:forProject] %>
      Pick a project contact
    <% end %>

    ... regular view here ...





Layer History
=============

Layers without history silence history entirely, even for subsequent navigations and child layers

.up-current works in layers without history



Accessing the current layer
===========================

(maybe skip this section)

up.layer.dismiss() will close the "current" layer.
up.layer.current is set to the right layer in compilers and most events, even if that layer is not the "front" layer.

You may also retrieve the current layer for later reference:

   let savedLayer = up.layer.current
   let update = () => up.render({ content: 'foo', layer: savedLayer })
   setTimeout(update, 10000) // will update savedLayer regardless what the current


Functions resolve earlier
=========================

In Unpoly 0.x async functions didn't settle until animation fnished.

Un Unpoly 1.0 Updates and removals resolve as soon as the DOM was changed.

This generally makes code more responsive:

    let user = await up.layer.ask({ url: '/users/new' })
    userSelect.value = user.id

If your code *does* need to wait:

    up.render({ url: '/foo', transition: true, onAppeared: () => console.log("Transition has finished!") })

    up.destroy(element,, {
      onRemoved: () => console.log("Overlay has finished closing animation")
    })


Get rid of link helpers and macros
==================================

We had helpers like `content_links()` and macros like `[content-link]` that would:

- Make a link followable through Unpoly
- Set additional options like [up-preload] and [up-instant]
- Set a default target


Following links by default
--------------------------

You can tell Unpoly to follow *all* links:

    up.form.config.submitSelectors.push('form')
    up.link.config.followSelectors.push('a')

To allow external links and forms, skip URL containing "://":

    up.form.config.submitSelectors.push('form:not(action*="://")')
    up.link.config.followSelectors.push('a:not(href*="://")')

Note that individual links may still opt out of following by setting [up-follow=false]:

    <a href="/backend" up-follow="false">


Accelerating links by default
-----------------------------

If you want to default to [up-instant] and [up-preload]:

    up.link.config.instantSelectors.push('a')
    up.link.config.preloadSelectors.push('a')

If some links should not be accelerated (e.g. instant clicks feel wrong for buttons!), use a different CSS selector:

    up.link.config.instant.push('a':not(.btn)'')

Note that individual links may still opt out of following by setting [up-instant=false] or [up-preload=false]:

    <a href="/backend" up-instant="false">
    <a href="/expensive-path" up-preload="false">


Setting a default target
------------------------

You already learned this:

    .content              => [up-main]
    .content-for-modal    => [up-main=overlay] oder [up-main=modal]


Setting a transition for all navigations
----------------------------------------

I'm actually not a bug fan of this, but if you need to:

    up.fragment.config.navigateTransition = 'true'



Aborting earlier requests
=========================

Earlier Unpolys had a concurrency issue on slow connections:

- User clicks link #1
- Server takes link to respond to #1
- User clicks another link #2
- Server responds with #2
- Server responds with #1
- User sees effects of #1

User navigation now aborts existing requests:

- User clicks link #1
- Server takes link to respond to #1
- User clicks another link #2, Unpoly cancels request for #1
- Server responds with #2
- User sees effects of #2

You may disable this with { solo: false } (JS) or `up-solo="false"` (HTML)



Updates that are not navigation
===============================

NO LONGER CORRECT!

E.g. when updating a message counter:

    up.render({ target: '.unread-count', navigate: false })

This will set multiple options:

| Setting             | Effect                                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `history: false`    | Don't update URL bar or document title              |
| `solo: false`       | Don't cancel existing requests                      |
| `reveal: false`     | Don't scroll to the new element                     |
| `peel: false`       | Don't close overlays when targeting a veiled layer  |
| `feedback: false`   | Don't set .up-active on the origin link             |
| `focus: false`      | Don't focus ater update                             |


up.request() no longer caches by default
========================================

People have been using of a $.ajax replacement / simpler fetch



Smarter bandwidth usage
=======================

- Preloading is now automatically disabled on slow connections
- Only 5 preload requests are queued. Additional preload requests abort the oldest request.
- There is a single concurrency setting (default 4) for both regular requests and preload requests.
- Preload requests are aborted to make space for regular requests.
- The queue is now last-in-first-out. The assumption is that recently queued requests are caused by a recent user interaction.
- Preload requests have a default timeout (10 seconds).
- User navigation aborts existing requests.

Slow connection?
----------------

- User has data saving enabled
- User is on 2G connection
- Average response time > 850 ms

You can fine-tune this if you want:

    up.proxy.config.preloadQueueSize: 5
    up.proxy.config.preloadEnabled: 'auto'
    up.proxy.config.preloadTimeout: 10 * 1000
    up.proxy.config.preloadMaxResponseTime: 750
    up.proxy.config.preloadSampleSize: 3 // initial page load is first sample





Easy progmatic fragment changes
===============================

(((
    up.visit(url)             =>  up.render({ url: '/foo' })
    up.modal.visit(url)       =>  up.render({ layer: 'url', layer: 'new' })
    up.replace(target, url)   =>  up.render
    up.extract()

    All options everywhere.
)))


Empty layer:

```
up.layer.open()
// or
```

Content without target (will open in default target):

```
up.layer.open({ content: 'foo' })
```


Change content:

```
up.render('.foo', { content: 'inner' }
```


Derive target from new outer HTML:

```
up.render({ fragment: '<div class=".foo">inner</div>' })
```




New overlay HTML structure
==========================

We now use custom elements.


Old popups:

```
<div class="up-popup">
  <div class="up-popup-content">...</div>
  <div class="up-popup-dismiss">×</div>
</div>>
```

New popups:

```
<up-popup>
  <up-popup-content>...</up-popup-content>
  <up-popup-dismiss>×</up-popup-content>
</up-popup>
```


Old modal:

```
<div class="up-modal">
  <div class="up-modal-viewport">
    <div class="up-modal-dialog">
      <div class="up-modal-content">...</div>
      <div class="up-modal-dismiss">×</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

New modal:

```
<up-modal>
  <up-modal-viewport>
    <up-modal-box>
      <up-modal-content>...</div>
      <up-modal-dismiss>×</up-modal-dismiss>
    </up-modal-box>
  </up-modal-viewport>
</up-modal>
```

Customizing the appearance
--------------------------

If you have modified the appearance with CSS, you need to update selectors.

E.g.

Old CSS:

    .up-popup-content {
      background-color: #eeeeee;
    }

New CSS:

    up-popup-content {
      background-color: #eeeeee;
    }


The structure is no longer configurable
---------------------------------------

There is no up.modal.config.template anymore.

There is also no up.modal.flavors anymore.

You can use up:layer:opening to modify the layer as it becomes visible:

You can however add the structure in code:

    if (isChristmas()) {
      up.on('up:layer:opened', function(event) {
        up.element.affix(event.layer.element, '.santa-hat', text: 'Merry Christmas!')
      })
    }


Layer classes
-------------

You may also use up-class to add a class:

```
<a href="/confirm-erase" up-method="delete" up-layer="new" up-class="warning">Erase disk</a>
```

This will open:

```
<up-modal class="warning">
  ...
</up-modal>
```



Overlay sizes
=============

In earlier Unpoly, overlays grew with the size of the content.
Most projects have set sizes to modals.

All overlays now have set widths:

<a href="/path" up-layer="new" up-size="small">
<a href="/path" up-layer="new" up-size="medium">
<a href="/path" up-layer="new" up-size="large">

Table of default sizes:

| Mode      | Small   | Medium   | Large   |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| Modal     | 350px   | 650px    | 1000px  |
| Popup     | 180px   | 300px    | 550px   |
| Drawer    | 150px   | 340px    | 600px   |
| Cover     | 100%    | 100%     | 100%    |

These are generally wider than Bootstrap's counterparts.

(Demo)


Customizing sizes
-----------------

Customizable with CSS:

```
up-modal[size=medium] up-modal-box
  width: 300px
```



New layer mode: Cover
---------------------

```
<a href="/path" up-layer="cover">
```

Often seen on mobile apps.




Dismissability can be fine tuned
--------------------------------

Layer opts:


| Option                   | Effect              |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| `{ keyDismissable }`     | Enables dimissing with escape key                |
| `{ outsideDismissable }` | Enables dismissing by clicking on the background |
| `{ buttonDismissable }`  | Adds an "X" button to the layer |
| `{ dismissable }`        | Enables or disables everything above |

Set all of them together with { dismissable }



Tooltips are gone
=================

The tooltip component has been removed from Unpoly.

We want to focus on things that are hard to implement.

Alternatives:

- [Bootstrap tooltips](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/tooltips/)
- [Balloon.css](https://kazzkiq.github.io/balloon.css/) (CSS only)
- [Plain [title] attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title) (built into the browser)

Unpoly 1.0 will convert `[up-tooltip]` to `[title]`.


Tooltips don't work on mobile
-----------------------------

Touch devices [don't really have a "hover" state](https://makandracards.com/makandra/5117-touch-devices-don-t-have-mouseover-events).

That means that classic tooltips won't work on mobile. Consider a clickable popup instead:

```
<span up-layer="popup" up-content="Locking a user will prevent them from using the application">
  HELP
</span>
```



Loading error pages
===================

A new event `up:fragment:loaded` is [emitted](/up.emit) when the server responds with the HTML, before
the HTML is used to [change a fragment](/up.render).

Event listeners may call `event.preventDefault()` on an `up:fragment:loaded` event
to prevent any changes to the DOM and browser history. This is useful to detect
an entirely different page layout (like a maintenance page or fatal server error)
which should be open with a full page load:

    up.on('up:fragment:loaded', (event) => {
      let isMaintenancePage = event.response.getHeader('X-Maintenance')

      if (isMaintenancePage) {
        // Prevent the fragment update and don't update browser history
        event.preventDefault()

        // Make a full page load for the same request.
        event.request.loadPage()
      }
    })


A11Y
====

up-nav sets [aria-current]

focus cycle in layers

focus controllable by user. List focus options!

Already backported to 0.62:

- Links with an [`[up-instant]`](/a-up-instant) attribute can now be followed with the keyboard.
- Fragments that are being [destroyed](/up.destroy) now get an [`[aria-hidden=true]`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-hidden_attribute)
  attribute while its disappearance is being animated. When a fragment is being swapped with a new version, the old fragment version is also
  given `[aria-hidden=true]` while it's disappearing.
- [Modal dialogs](/up.modal) now get an [`[aria-modal=true]`](https://a11ysupport.io/tech/aria/aria-modal_attribute) attribute.



Major breaking changes
======================

We still support deprecated APIs going back to 2016.

- Faster resolution, use onAppeared onRemoved
- failOptions (you probably won't notice)
- New HTML structure for overlays
  - Modal flavors are out
  - Custom modal templates are out
- Tooltips are just titles
- [up-layer=modal] used to mean "in an existing modal", it now means "open a new modal".


Boostrap integration
====================

Unpoly 1.0 now supports the three major Bootstrap versions we're using:

- unpoly-bootstrap3.js
- unpoly-bootstrap3.css
- unpoly-bootstrap4.js
- unpoly-bootstrap4.css
- unpoly-bootstrap5.js
- unpoly-bootstrap5.css

Integration is now minimal
--------------------------

Many projects didn't actually end up using the built-in Bootstrap integration, because it was too opinionated. E.g. Unpoly tried to re-use the Bootstrap modal styles, but most projects simply wanted the white box from the Unpoly default.

They ended up using their own configuration, which is much more minimal.

Unpoly 1.0 now ships with a **minimal Bootstrap integration**:

This is unpoly-boostrap4.js:

    // Bootstrap expects the class .active instead of .up-active
    up.feedback.config.currentClasses.push('active')

    // Set .up-current classes in Bootstrap navigation components
    up.feedback.config.navs.push('.nav', '.navbar')

    // When validating, update the closest form group with the results
    up.form.config.validateTargets.unshift('.form-group:has(&)')

    // When revealing, scroll far enough so content is not covered by
    # fixed Bootstrap bars
    up.viewport.config.fixedTop.push('.navbar.fixed-top')
    up.viewport.config.fixedBottom.push('.navbar.fixed-bottom')
    up.viewport.config.anchoredRight.push('.navbar.fixed-top', '.navbar.fixed-bottom')

    // Don't use common utility classes to build selectors
    up.fragment.config.badTargetClasses.push(
      /^row$/,
      /^col(-xs|-sm|-md|-lg|-xl)?(-\d+)?$/,
      /^[mp][tblrxy]?-\d+$/
    )

This is unpoly-bootstrap4.scss:

    // If a container is shown in an overlay, don't add to the existing
    // padding of the overlay box.
    up-modal, up-drawer, up-popup {
      .container, .container-fluid {
        padding-left: 0;
        padding-right: 0;
      }
    }


Stability
=========

- When a compiler throws an error, other compilers will now run anyway
- When a destructor throws an error, other destructors will now run anyway


New log
=======

- Flat
- Function is highlighted at the beginning


Others
======

- Focus, selection, caret is preserved when updating a fragment that contains focus


Great taming of defaults
=========================

up.render() does not navigate by default

up.fetch() (was: up.request()) does not cache by default
